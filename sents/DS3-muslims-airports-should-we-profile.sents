Makedde	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	1	Over my dead body.First of all, how will you tell someone is a Muslim?
Makedde	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	1	You cant just pick people out and ask 'are you a Muslim' because people can lie.
Makedde	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	1	You think a terrorist is going to admit they plan on blowing up a building?You are going to have to find a way to know what religion people belong to, without going by their clothes or physical appearence.
Makedde	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	1	There is no way to tell whether someone is a Muslim - you have to rely on them to tell you.The idea of airport screening Muslims is stupid because you don't have a way of detecting who is a Muslim and who isn't.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	2	True enough, but just to play devils advocate... what if material is discovered that indicates he/she may be muslim?
E_Pluribus_Venom	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	2	A Koran in luggage or some form of islamic paraphernalia for instance.
E_Pluribus_Venom	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	4	The United States has never fallen victim to a non-muslim terrorist?edit: thank you for actually defending your view.
SpankyTheWhale	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	5	Non-Muslim terrorism does not affect America currently.
Rampant.A.I.	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	6	We do need to not be afraid of possibly discriminating against someone for no reason when the lives of others are at stake.
Rampant.A.I.	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	6	It sucks, it's terrible, but it's downright stupid not to heighten security around people who generally fit a profile for being a possible risk.
Rampant.A.I.	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	6	I hate the idea of profiling people based on their religion, especially when there are so few actual extremists, and many many innocent people who happen to share similar beliefs.
Rampant.A.I.	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	6	It would be pretty foolhardy to start screening Muslims/people of Middle Eastern descent exclusively.
E_Pluribus_Venom	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	7	Neither do people Japanese military attempting to access U.S. air bases, yet we're instructed to inform OSI if that were to occur.
E_Pluribus_Venom	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	7	Timeline doesn't matter.
SpankyTheWhale	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	8	So because of one vestigial policy that has become a possible imperfection, we should create further imperfections and deliberately obscure the situation at hand?
E_Pluribus_Venom	Rampant.A.I.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	9	....when the lives of others are at stake.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Rampant.A.I.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	9	That's pretty broad, no? Take drunk driving for instance.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Rampant.A.I.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	9	As of 2008, Caucasians 18 and over account for 87% of DUI arrests that year.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Rampant.A.I.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	9	Should we simply approach caucasians as they enter a vehicle and administer breathalyzer tests?
E_Pluribus_Venom	Rampant.A.I.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	9	After all... lives are at stake.
E_Pluribus_Venom	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	11	I'm not calling for creating further imperfections.
E_Pluribus_Venom	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	11	I'm against both your policy and that of the U.S. Air Force regarding OSI involvement with only certain individuals.
SpankyTheWhale	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	12	Yeah, I know what you said.
SpankyTheWhale	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	13	If you suspect it, or he fits the bill, it is his patriotic duty to enjoy the fact that America has risen so far above internment camps.
E_Pluribus_Venom	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	14	We put Chuck Norris in charge of pointing you out.
E_Pluribus_Venom	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	14	He's an expert at this sort of thing.
SpankyTheWhale	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	15	There are other signs of drunkenness that can be addressed to more precisely contain the issue.
E_Pluribus_Venom	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	16	Sure there are... but that assumes people are unable to contain/disguise their drunkenness (which isn't always the case).
E_Pluribus_Venom	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	16	Much better to just use their whiteness, yes?
E_Pluribus_Venom	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	16	No hiding that.
SpankyTheWhale	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	17	Can they contain their drunkenness enough to drive unsuspiciously?
CB4	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	18	I see and we no longer focus on equality?
CB4	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	18	Should Muslims simply wear a piece of cloth in the future to be identified?
CB4	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	18	That is plausible.
E_Pluribus_Venom	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	20	No... as experienced cops will tell you Field sobriety tests like &quot;walking a straight line&quot; don't always work with people who blow over the limit.
E_Pluribus_Venom	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	20	Better to test due to their whiteness right of the bat.
E_Pluribus_Venom	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	20	Come on man, stop being PC.
E_Pluribus_Venom	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	21	as if terrorists will comply.
Makedde	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	22	How would anyone be permitted to go through your luggage if they didn't know you were a Muslim?
Makedde	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	22	Unless they made it obvious, which I think would be a little silly, as these terrorists are going to find ways around it.You make it hard for them to do something, they'll simply try something else.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Courtney203	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	26	Sure, but I want to highlight &quot;signs of trouble&quot; in your post.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Courtney203	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	26	Is being muslim a sign of trouble?
Rampant.A.I.	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	27	No, but it would make sense to stop more caucasians at field sobriety tests given that they're statistically more likely to be DUI.
Makedde	Rampant.A.I.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	28	Why stop more?
Makedde	Rampant.A.I.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	28	Why not stop them all?
Makedde	Rampant.A.I.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	28	You would be stopping all Muslims, wouldn't you, so lets make it fair and stop all of any other group likely to be a danger.
Makedde	Rampant.A.I.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	28	At least then it'd be fairer.
Mindovermatter	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	29	It's one of many signs of trouble.
Mindovermatter	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	29	If you are being profiled for simply being muslim the wait times in airport will increase 10x, that's impractical.
Mindovermatter	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	29	However, if TSA notices many things &quot;off&quot; with someone and then they see a koran they need to be taken aside and questioned.
Mindovermatter	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	29	Bottom line: Not profiling Muslims is going to lead to another 9/11.
Mindovermatter	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	30	Because You don't understand the inner workings of national security.
Mindovermatter	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	30	Forget the inner working you don't understand the first thing to it.
Makedde	Mindovermatter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	31	Bullcrap.
Makedde	Mindovermatter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	31	You take someone aside because they have a Quran?
Makedde	Mindovermatter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	31	OMG they have a book they must be planning to blow us up?
Makedde	Mindovermatter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	31	Question them?
Makedde	Mindovermatter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	31	More like waterboard them until they confess to being terrorists - what will they have to say to satisfy the Yanks that they are not planning on harming people?I don't trust America.
Makedde	Mindovermatter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	31	I can see Muslims being pulled aside and locked away without charge for being so called terrorists.Don't believe me? Its already happened.
Makedde	Mindovermatter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	31	That's America for you.
HillBilly	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	32	well Mak , as always , I greatly respect your views and opinions.... and you've always been fair to me and treated me with respect and courtesy.but , as this thread is concerned , I just don't know what to say...
HillBilly	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	32	I have no axe to grind as far as Muslims &amp; Islam..... or anyone that professes that religion....
HillBilly	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	32	However , if someone that I loved were going to be on that same plane flight , would I be in favor of &quot; profiling &quot; ??????YES , I WOULD...... and there needs to be more intensive testing equipmentfor WMD and Chemical detectors.... that would stop these suicidal nuts... that's the way that I see it ....
Rampant.A.I.	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	33	Well no, you're right.
Rampant.A.I.	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	33	It would be ridiculous to stop all Muslim people based on their faith, assuming you could even identify them.What I was saying is that there appears to be (to me) a lot of social/political backlash against stopping a larger number of Muslims than other groups, even if security has due cause (apart from their religion) to stop them.
Rampant.A.I.	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	33	Obviously, everyone possible should be screened, and ideally each individual person would be screened, but it's not feasible.
Rampant.A.I.	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	33	I don't know.
Rampant.A.I.	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	33	Maybe I'm operating off of a prejudice here.
Rampant.A.I.	Mindovermatter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	33	The point I was trying to make is that if the TSA notices anything is &quot;off&quot; about somebody, they should have no hesitation in stopping them for questioning.
Rampant.A.I.	Mindovermatter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	33	Period.
Rampant.A.I.	Mindovermatter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	33	Being accused of racial/religious profiling shouldn't be as much a concern as finding out why a particular person seems to be a little &quot;off.&quot;But detaining someone just because they happen to be Muslim is ridiculous.
Mindovermatter	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	34	I'm sorry lady, but as usual you are not seeing the bigger picture.
Mindovermatter	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	34	YOu can't always think with your heart when LIVES are at stake.
Mindovermatter	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	34	I'd rather have some mama's boy offended for being profiled than americans die.
Mindovermatter	Rampant.A.I.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	35	I agree with you.
Mindovermatter	Rampant.A.I.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	35	And the point I was trying to make is if the liberals get their way and we don't profile muslims, I'm afraid it will go to far and TSA will be hesitant to confront a possible terrorist for the sake of PC, and because of PC we will have another 9/11

Courtney203	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	37	no, not being muslim alone , but a muslim acting suspiciously is a sign of trouble.
Courtney203	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	37	When I see a muslim I naturally take a 2nd glance just due to the current world affairs.
Courtney203	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	37	Now defining what &quot;acting suspiciously&quot; is difficult.
Courtney203	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	37	It would be up to the person making the observation.
Mindovermatter	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	38	Discuss what?
Mindovermatter	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	38	that's retarded.
Mindovermatter	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	38	It's a waste of manpower to &quot;run up to caucasions and start performing breathalyzer test on them&quot;.
Mindovermatter	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	38	However if a cop sees a person who appears drunk, and he happens to be caucasion, the cop knows there is about a 9/10 chance this person drinks and drives.work smarter not harder.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Courtney203	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	39	....anyone acting suspiciously in an airport is a sign of trouble.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Mindovermatter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	40	It's essentially the same concept.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Mindovermatter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	40	One group is statistically higher at committing an act than others, thus the concept that said group deserves additional scrutiny.

Mindovermatter	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	41	So far all terrorists and potential terrorists since 9/11 have been muslim.

Mindovermatter	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	41	No we're going to keep an eye on them.

Mindovermatter	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	42	why?
Mindovermatter	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	42	because it's more effective.
Mindovermatter	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	42	Of course they are looking for everyone dui'ing but after there 50'th dui arrest and 44 of them are white males are you telling me a cop with an IQ above 100 is going to just overlook that and not look out for white men drinking and driving?
Mindovermatter	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	42	Just accept defeat, you have no argument here.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Mindovermatter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	44	I would expect a police officer to enforce the law, not break it.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Mindovermatter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	44	Racial profiling is illegal.

E_Pluribus_Venom	Mindovermatter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	45	Keep your eye on viable threats, yes.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Mindovermatter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	45	They're currently a minority out of billions of practicing muslims... and no minority should represent a majority.
The Dude	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	46	I voted no.
The Dude	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	46	It would be a waste of time and resources to stop every Muslim and to have them questioned.
The Dude	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	46	Should we stop every Hispanic and make sure they are legal citizens?
The Dude	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	46	Of course not, it would be absurd and wrong to profile anyone based on race or religion.

stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	50	It doesn't.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	50	Unless the law is made for the purpose of being PC or being tolerant simply for the sake of tolerance!

stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	50	Even if it makes you feel better about yourself.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	51	It should make everyone feel better considering the fact that allowing it in one case is essentially opening the door to its use in a variety of crimes, as I've already touched upon earlier in this very thread.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	51	Certain races are predominant offenders of certain crimes...although those who commit said crimes are the minority (of their respective race) in each case.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	51	It's my belief that every day Americans support short-sighted policy until they're affected directly.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	51	Consider the right's (and my own) uproar/protest following Janet Napolitano's report that named returning war veterans considerable threats.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	51	It struck a nerve because people were able to put a close picture to who she was describing.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	51	It hit home, and the same doesn't register with Americans who have a stereotypical view of who a muslim is. Had she said something like &quot;muslim enlistees going to basic training are terrorist risks&quot;, imagine the support from that same side.
Kimaris	SamS	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	53	Thank you.
Kimaris	SamS	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	53	I don't understand why people get upset when that is said.
Kimaris	SamS	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	53	You are more likely to be killed by an Anti-Government White Nationalist Militia (KKK, Ayran Brotherhood, Neo-Nazis) than you are from some Islamo-fascist.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	54	So what?
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	54	If 100% of a certain crime is committed by white guys with Nazi tattoos you would be pretty stupid to get all PC and start looking at old black women after said crime is committed.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	54	But you'd feel better?
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	54	Please.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	54	Old white women don't car jack people.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	54	Sorry.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	54	0% would be the number.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	54	So it stands to reason if you want to solve the crime you start with those likely to have done it.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	54	My grandma isn't one of those people.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	54	If that means you profile young, urban black guys, so be it.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	54	So sue me for being logical and practical.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	54	Muslims are the ones trying to blow people up on planes.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	54	Look at them more closely and you will prevent more incidents like at Christmas.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	54	As you were being all PC and strip searching Jewish women I would have found the explosives.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	54	Not PC?
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	54	Great.
Frogger	Kimaris	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	56	That statemen is simply untrue.How many people have been killed by Anti-Government White Nationalists Militias members, Ayran Brothers, or Neo-Nazis since 9/11?
Frogger	Kimaris	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	56	Liberals always like to make statements like that but they are patently false.
stekim	Frogger	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	57	That having been said, they have threatened the President.
stekim	Frogger	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	57	So I'm totally fine with the Secret Service looking at members of such groups more closely.
stekim	Frogger	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	57	How that is somehow wrong escapes me. I guess they should look at all groups equally?
stekim	Frogger	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	57	Thereby making it more likely that they miss the neo-nazi who is actually the threat.
stekim	Frogger	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	57	When PC makes you stupid it's time to abandon it.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	58	A white guy with nazi tattoos, who has committed no crime, is not a threat until you have probable cause.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	58	Your analogy is also off because white guys with nazi tattoos are exclusive, whereas muslims are one of (if not the most) diverse groups in this country.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	58	Take the most recent attempt on Christmas.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	58	Not exactly your &quot;raghead durka durka&quot; image most comics run with.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	58	There's nothing logical or practical about holding a majority of people responsible for the acts of a few.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	58	As of 2008, whites accounted for the most DUI's that year.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	58	Administering breathalyzers to white citizens (if they're seen attempting to access a vehicle) is the type of nonsense you're talking about implementing... and no... people would not support it.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	58	I can already hear the calls of &quot;you took my freedom!&quot;.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	58	I also notice your complete disregard for my proof of this theory with Janet Napolitano's terrorist risk assessment and citizen reaction.
Frogger	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	59	Any terrorist group should be closely watched but the statement that people are more likely to be killed by Aryan Brothers or KKK members is simply false.
Frogger	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	59	It is another of those lies that liberals like to toss around.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	60	Equating muslims and neo-nazis for analogical purposes is your first mistake.
Kimaris	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	61	There isn't much difference between Neo-Nazis and Islamo-facists.
Kimaris	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	61	One discriminates and kills over race and one kills and discriminates and kills over religious ideology.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Kimaris	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	62	Islamo-fascists, yes.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Kimaris	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	62	Muslims, no.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Kimaris	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	62	For some reason, people see &quot;muslim&quot; and often think &quot;extremist&quot; or &quot;islamo-fascists&quot;.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	63	What do you mean?
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	63	If a group is committing or threatening to commit certain crimes it's fair to look at them more closely for said crimes.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	63	The analogy fits perfectly.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	63	Further, neo-nazi's and Muslim extremists are not all that far apart ideologically.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	63	But since one cannot tell a Muslim from a Muslim extremist at an airport one needs to take extra care with all Muslims before they board a plane.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	64	And?
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	64	I'm not suggesting we pull Muslims over at random and hassle them.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	64	Who is doing that?
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	64	Neither do I. However, I have no issue with police waiting outside the bar at 3am and following some white guy looking to see if he can drive straight.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	64	But to be fair should they also wait outside the retirement home?
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	64	Just so they do not appear to be profiling young white bar hoppers?
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	64	Great idea!
Ostap Bender	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	66	Many europeans refuse to fly together with muslims and give their tickets back.
Ostap Bender	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	66	BTW many want establisment of spearate flights for muslims.
The Dude	Crawdadr	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	67	Because profiling humans is a little different than profiling cows.

The Dude	Crawdadr	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	71	It wouldn't matter if we did profile.
The Dude	Crawdadr	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	71	Once they know what we are looking for, do you honestly think that will keep doing it?
The Dude	Crawdadr	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	71	Of course not.
The Dude	Crawdadr	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	71	They would just adapt, and then we would be pulling innocent people out of line and questioning them while the terrorists go unnoticed.
catalinacat	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	72	Ah... forget about it - don't worry yourself - it'll never happen.
catalinacat	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	72	Just hope your sister or brother, or partner, or children are not in harm's way when the next depressed, persecuted muslim goes on a rampage or bombs a plane, etc. because it was just not politically correct to follow up on reports from his father he was a threat and put him on a no-fly list.The mistake here was, there was NO FOLLOW -THROUGH, when a proven threat existed.
catalinacat	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	72	This threat did not happen because he wasn't profiled.
catalinacat	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	72	This is about doing the (*)(*)(*)(*) job in the first place of preventing a reported potential threat from having free range, by the heads of security that are hired to do the job.
catalinacat	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	72	It's in your face clear that both Hasan and this character were threats.

Crawdadr	The Dude	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	73	If they adapted then the math would show that and the profile would no longer fit.
Crawdadr	The Dude	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	73	Thus it would have to stop in favor of a new profile.But so far I still have not seen why it is right to profile animals and objects but wrong to profile humans.
Ostap Bender	catalinacat	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	74	Thanks for your good post, Cat!
stekim	The Dude	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	75	Then how do you explain that they know what we are looking for and keep doing it anyway?
Frogger	The Dude	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	77	I would agree if they were being profiled to be sent to camps like the Japanese Americans were during WWII but this profiling merely says they are being looked at more closely as members of a group that has a much greater incidence of terrorists than other groups.

pragueman	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	79	We have a system of security in airports.
pragueman	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	79	We are already doing it.
pragueman	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	79	This is not about randomly searching Muslims on the street.
pragueman	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	79	This is about airports where you willingly subject yourself to checks.
pragueman	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	79	The question is should it be random or should we look closer at Muslim travelers if we know they are Muslim.
pragueman	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	79	My answer is yes.
pragueman	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	79	We should still do random searches, but we SHOULD look closer at Muslim travelers if we know they are Muslim.
pragueman	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	79	Nothing wrong with it at all.

E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	82	Sure, neo-nazi's and muslim extremists.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	82	You're proposing that we profile just muslims... while using a neo-nazi analogy.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	82	Doesn't work.
E_Pluribus_Venom	catalinacat	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	84	First, the would-be terrorist in question doesn't even fit the look of an individual that'd be pulled aside for random screening... so what was PC?
E_Pluribus_Venom	catalinacat	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	84	Second, I don't do emotional tirades with short-sited logic.

Cajun Controller	Xilaisalt	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	96	Sounds good to me, and they could still do a random screening, but use a little common sense.

Patriot911	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	97	I fully acknowledge that.

Patriot911	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	97	Reality is that there are people out there looking to blow up planes.
Patriot911	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	97	We can focus on random people or we can focus on those who are far more likely to be terrorists.
Patriot911	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	97	Political correctness demands we make it random lest we offend.
Patriot911	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	97	Logic and common sense dictate you target those who fit the profile.
Patriot911	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	97	One life is worth far more than a pissed off demographic.

SpankyTheWhale	Addison48	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	108	Not airport terrorists.

Addison48	Frogger	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	112	We only need to check out people who act suspicious.
Makedde	Addison48	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	113	One can be a terrorist and not act suspicious, though - do you check those who don't look suspicious?
Makedde	Frogger	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	113	I don't think that is the point, Frogger.
Makedde	Frogger	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	113	If Christians can be shown to have committed the most attacks against abortion clinics, then by rights, Christians should be profiled before they step near an abortion clinic, right?

Makedde	Ostap Bender	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	115	Ostap, that could be anyone.Just because someone lives in a Muslim country doesn't make them Muslim, and anyone can lie about their religion.
Makedde	Ostap Bender	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	115	It would be very easy to do.
Makedde	Ostap Bender	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	115	If a Muslim wished to blow something up, they be careful to avoid detection.
Makedde	Ostap Bender	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	115	They'd dress like an American, they'd have no religious whatever in their bags, they'd lie about their religious beliefs.
Makedde	Ostap Bender	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	115	They'll get around it.

Makedde	Ostap Bender	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	115	Which is disgusting.
Makedde	Ostap Bender	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	115	If that happens, we could then have people claiming they don't want to fly with blacks or gays, and that black folk and homosexuals should have their own separate flights.

Frogger	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	116	Yes, a terrorist might not act suspiciously but many do and people who do should be given greater scrutiny.
Frogger	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	116	Since the incidence of Christian attacking abortion clinics is so small your suggestion is silly.
Frogger	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	116	If there were only one or two Muslim terrorists there would be no need to profile them.
Frogger	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	116	You being pissed off does not matter if it helps insure the safety of others.

Addison48	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	117	I didnt mean we should only have people who act suspicious walk through metal detectors and have their bags sent through the x-ray.
Addison48	Makedde	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	117	I just meant the suspicious acting people should be the only ones we pull to the side to check futher.
E_Pluribus_Venom	pragueman	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	118	By the applied (if they fit the profile, then they deserve extra scrutiny) logic, the analogy makes perfect sense.
E_Pluribus_Venom	pragueman	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	118	We could establish mandatory breathalyzers if, when pulled over, you're white... without probable cause (because statistically, they're the highest DUI offenders).
E_Pluribus_Venom	pragueman	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	118	Checks can even be established at bridge/highway tolls.
E_Pluribus_Venom	pragueman	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	118	That isn't &quot;randomly searching for people on the street&quot;.

E_Pluribus_Venom	pragueman	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	118	Until Americans begin to identify with who is being profiled.
E_Pluribus_Venom	pragueman	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	118	Take, for instance, Janet Napolitano's report that assessed returning war veterans as potential terrorist risks.
E_Pluribus_Venom	pragueman	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	118	Ponder, for a moment, the outrage that transpired... calls for removal even.

E_Pluribus_Venom	pragueman	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	118	&quot;nothing at all&quot; is wrong with profiling until it hits home, and opening the door to its use in some areas with eventually lead to totalitarianism... and people thought Obama was trying to take your freedom away.

teamosil	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	120	There have been 95 convictions of white supremacist terrorist organizations in the US for terrorism or attempted mass murder in the US since the Oklahoma City bombing some 15 years ago.
teamosil	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	120	9/11 was a far biggest terrorist attack than any other in our country's history, but the vast majority of terrorism incidents in the country has always been and remain today from white supremacist groups.
E_Pluribus_Venom	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	122	Which is why I belief any advocation for the given scenario is extremely short-sighted.
E_Pluribus_Venom	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	122	It seems the goal of terrorism (fear) is working... as it's caused people to adopt unconstitutional means of profiling, even without laying out a framework on how they plan to actually profile a religion, which it wouldn't be... so let's stop kidding ourselves.
E_Pluribus_Venom	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	122	It would be profiling people who fit the stereotypical image.
cassandrabandra	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	123	but how do you pick a muslim?I know a lot of Muslims who don't look &quot;Muslim&quot; - they are fair skinned and of germano-celtic appearance.
cassandrabandra	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	123	how are you going to pick them?do we instigate an international law that means we all have to identify our religion on our passport?passports are issued every 10 years in my country - If someone gets a passport at 18, and identify as christian, or atheist or whatever at that time (and assuming they have to provide some documentary proof of their religious convictions) whats to say they will still be that at 27?If I knew I would be targetted for profiling due to religion, then I would not be carrying anything that would indicate I was a Muslim ... and yet as a non Muslim I often have a scarf or two, maybe a sarong, in my baggage - would this be taken as Islamic paraphenalia?
CB4	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	124	Exactly.
CB4	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	124	I mean the same individuals advocating that Healthcare Reform Bill is unconstitutional are the same individuals advocating the use of racial profiling.

cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	125	yep.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	125	dumb.maybe we make all Muslims wear some kind of insignia - something like the Star of David?Better still - we could round them all up and tattoo them - that way we give them each a number so we know which muslims are who - and anyone who converts has to register with the local authorities - maybe imams could be sentenced to hard labour for not notifying the authorities of converts.gee, there are really lots of solutions.probably the best would be banning them all from flying, and putting them all in huge concentration camps so the authorities can keep an eye on them.

cassandrabandra	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	150	There are plenty of Muslims who may/may not be susceptible to terrorist ideology and who are NOT middle eastern in appearance.I know plenty of pale skinned Arabs, including some with blue eyes, and there are also numerous eastern european Muslims and converts from various other backgrounds.as I said - we have to identify our religion on a passport?do we get a new passport/ID card every time we fly in case we've converted in the meantime?regardless of the fact that there are a whole range of other issues around profiling, its just too easy to bypass.they need to develop more efficient screening methods - and act on the intelligence they do have.
E_Pluribus_Venom	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	151	It wouldn't be profiling muslims, cassandra.
E_Pluribus_Venom	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	151	It would be profiling the most known image of the muslim identity (to a naive/uneducated public)... which is counter-productive to a &quot;policy&quot; that seeks to &quot;effectively&quot; screen a demographic that poses the highest threat.

cassandrabandra	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	155	such a system, if installed, would be quicker than what we currently experience in airports.In Turkey I found that entering some bus stations and airports you got screened when you entered the airport/bus terminal.
cassandrabandra	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	155	I thought that was a good idea, too.
cassandrabandra	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	155	But I think too that if information is available on a passenger (as it appeared to be with the latest one) then there should be a bit more attention paid to that person.
cassandrabandra	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	155	he wasn't of middle eastern appearance, so if profiling that group, as EPV says - they would have missed him.That demonstrates why you have to be smart in dealing with this, and not rely on sterotypes..

cassandrabandra	Addison48	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	354	You may well save your child's life as well as those of countless other people.But overcoming the denial would take a lot of strength.

cassandrabandra	Addison48	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	356	yep - and I guess that most parents, regardless of religion, or lack of for that matter, feel that way.

shpraralain	&#402;(x)	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	366	You might be as well.
Lady Luna	(x)	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	367	Not unless a bunch of African men start trying to commit terrorist acts, and if they do then yes.
(x)	Lady Luna	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	368	So we won't start profiling them until they commit an attack; great strategy.
Lady Luna	(x)	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	370	So your solution would be what?One individual does not create a profile.

teamosil	daisydotell	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	372	Religious profiling is unconstitutional and immoral of course, but it's also completely ineffective.

teamosil	daisydotell	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	372	It's a ridiculously weak indicator of likelyhood to commit terrorism...
teamosil	daisydotell	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	372	Hundreds of millions of muslim males between 18 and 35 fly in the US each year and what, maybe one of them on average commits any kind of terrorism?
teamosil	daisydotell	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	372	They're focused on far stronger indicators like how someone behaves in line, financial transactions, watchlists, patterns like one way tickets and not checking luggage, etc. Trying to get them to refocus their approach around religious profiling instead would be wildly counter productive.That the same people support torturing muslims as support profiling muslims is no huge surprise...
teamosil	daisydotell	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	372	Both are clearly ineffective, so obviously the motive doesn't actually have anything to do with security...

cassandrabandra	Lady Luna	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	374	maybe we just need to introduce laws so that everybody has to carry a card identifying their religion, make Muslims wear a special symbol so they can be picked out easily, and punish them for non compliance.lets ban them all from flying!
cassandrabandra	Lady Luna	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	374	that would solve all your problems .... might not address the extremely high rate of murders in the US but it would certainly prevent any Islamic terrorist attacks (when was the last successful one?)

daisydotell	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	376	Profiling should not be the only means to recognize a terrorist.
daisydotell	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	376	Maybe when enough profiling is done, the muslims will police their own people so other nations won't have to profile.
teamosil	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	378	Have any of the terrorists to attack planes so far had what you would consider outwards signs of being muslim?
teamosil	daisydotell	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	379	Searching people more extensively based on their being middle eastern or wearing some kind of islamic garb does not work.
teamosil	daisydotell	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	379	The TSA says it doesn't work, every expert whose opinion I've ever read on the matter says it doesn't work...
teamosil	daisydotell	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	379	The only folks who are pushing it are some of the right wing politicians who know they can score points with some elements of the public by proposing ideas like this that they know no whitehouse could ever implement since it would require a constitutional ammendment and doesn't work anyways...
teamosil	daisydotell	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	379	Nobody, conservative or liberal, who actually works with airport security policy actually thinks this is a good idea.
teamosil	daisydotell	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	379	So your feeling is that the best way to discourage muslims from supporting terrorism against the US is to discriminate against innocent people because they are muslim?
teamosil	daisydotell	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	379	Groups like Al Qaeda thrive on exagerated stereotypes of the US's intolerance of Islam and interventionism.
teamosil	daisydotell	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	379	The way to address that isn't to make those stereotypes true for no actual reason...Think about it like this.
teamosil	daisydotell	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	379	If you want to Africa and they subjected you to additional searches, maybe they detained some people you were travelling with long enough that they missed their planes, etc, and the reason they did it was clearly because you are a Christian and so are the white supremacist terrorist organizations, would you come home suddenly more inspired to fight white supremacy than you were before?
teamosil	daisydotell	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	379	Or would you be angry and more open to anti-Africa foreign policy?
shpraralain	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	380	I completely disagree with your statement.
shpraralain	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	380	Many Muslims, esp. males do not wear traditional garb..and please do not forget American converts and seculars.
RPA1	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	381	What do you suggest?
shpraralain	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	382	I have posted my suggestions several times.
shpraralain	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	382	I applaud what Israel is doing, basically, with emphasis on behavioral profiling.
shpraralain	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	382	That's the very short version.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	Yeah, that's a big one.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	Supposedly it does work well.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	That totally surprises me though...
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	How hard is it to act you DON'T have a bomb for 3 minutes...
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	But yeah, if it works, I'm for it and supposedly it does.Also, I'd support more of those air-puffer machines replacing metal detectors, better technology for identifying weapons in carry ons and things like that.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	Trying to figure out which people to screen thoroughly is just a bad approach.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	Whatever criteria we come up with for picking those people can be circumvented.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	It just creates blindspots.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	If we strip search everybody who has a koran with them or whatever, they won't bring korans.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	If we search everybody who looks middle eastern, they'll use non-middle eastern bombers.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	If we search all the men, they'll use women.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	If we search all the adults, they'll use children.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	There is no way to win that game.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	This isn't like trying to identify who is most likely to get in a bar fight on a particular night.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	Al Qaeda is a smart, careful, strategically sophisticated group.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	We aren't going to beat them with such obvious and predictable tactics.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	All it does is devote resources to wild goose chases and create a false sense of security.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	The only real solutions are those that will be applied to every single passenger.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	Any thing we only apply to a clear cut, predefined, group of the passengers won't ever be applied to an actual terrorist.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	You can't do an individual search of every passenger without basically making air travel impractical.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	So, IMO, we need to focus on ways to improve the level of screening we can apply to the entire pool of passengers in non-invasive, non-time-consuming, ways.
teamosil	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	383	That means more technology.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	384	you mean like the full body scanners used in Moscow?http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8436611.stm
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	385	Yeah.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	385	I don't know the relative merits of the different machines, but whatever works best.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	385	I've actually been through one of those machines in the Netherlands a while back when it was still very experimental.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	385	That might even have just been a prototype because they ran everybody through the usual metal detector then just volunteers through that thing, so I think it was just a trial run basically.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	385	Seemed cool to me, although I think that's the one that some people have been concerned about being able to more or less see you naked, which is an issue...
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	385	I think they were talking about implementing policies to keep the viewers visible only to same gender operators and whatnot...
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	385	Not sure, but I know that was a big hang up with it.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	386	well, hey - maybe its time we got over our hangups about nudity then.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	386	Its not like we don't KNOW what human bodies look like - so there's no need to be shy.and if this scanner could have picked up the Nigerian guy (which according to several sources it would have done) maybe its worth it.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	386	although if saving lives is the object of restrictive or invasive practices, airport security would not be that high on my list to be honest.But back to the scanners - LOL - I'm past middle age and not centrefold material, but I couldn't give a hoot about a professional doing their job seeing what I looked like without clothes on.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	386	You're not a sex object (or object of hilarity) to someone in that position.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	386	Although it would be appropriate to have same gender operators for those who may be sensitive - for whatever reason.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	388	either/or.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	388	if the technology is there - why isn't in place in all airports with direct flights to the US, if addressing terrorism on aeroplanes is such an important issue?It should be de rigeur if they want to take this seriously thetechnology has clearly been around for a while.and if terrorism is such a concern, people shouldn't get all delicate over a moments (possible) embarrasment.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	388	If they do - maybe its not terrorism thats the concern, but the opportunity to stick the boots in to people who are &quot;different.&quot;
RPA1	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	389	Maybe there is a misunderstanding here.
RPA1	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	389	I am against screening folks on the basis of their beliefs which (I imagine) would be having folks declare their religion.
RPA1	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	389	To me that is counterproductive.
RPA1	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	389	However if a 17 to 40 year old male (for instance) has any outward sign of being Muslim, the profiling should kick in at the level of being watched.
RPA1	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	389	If that person is intent on bombing a plane his actions will betray him at which point he should be questioned and searched...I would not assign that level of scrutiny to a woman, a geriatric man, a grandma in a wheelchair etc. If that is profiling...so be it...it concentrates the effort on those most likely to commit the act.
E_Pluribus_Venom	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	391	Of those captured for attempted terrorism aboard an airliner, how many of them show outward signs of being muslim?
RPA1	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	392	What is your solution?
daisydotell	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	393	And what if you did miss your plane only to find out they discovered a terrorist by profiling...would that make you feel better?
daisydotell	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	393	Life isn't fair and sometimes people who don't want to play by the rules actually have to obey the rules.
daisydotell	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	393	To think middle east countries will do a better job of policing their own is delusional but it looks like that is what it will take or they can suffer through being profiled.
daisydotell	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	393	If it saves your life you will be happy?
daisydotell	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	393	If it saved my life or the life of someone I loved, you better believe profiling will be the order of the day.
E_Pluribus_Venom	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	394	Full body scanners.
E_Pluribus_Venom	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	394	Can you answer my question, please?
RPA1	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	396	I don't know in any case it matters not...that is only 1 criteria I mentioned.
RPA1	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	396	Apparently the general agrees with me although he supports strip searching any young Muslim man.
changed	Craig	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	397	Prats?
changed	Craig	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	397	Like Spencer Pratts????

changed	Craig	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	397	It was funny
Divine Wind	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	398	Fear-mongering is a popular component of Fox News.
Divine Wind	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	398	FOX must stand for &quot;Fear Optimizes Xenophobia&quot;.
E_Pluribus_Venom	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	399	Why wouldn't it matter?
E_Pluribus_Venom	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	399	Those captured displayed no &quot;outward signs of being muslim&quot;... so where would you method get us?
E_Pluribus_Venom	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	399	Explain... then explain why they wouldn't just stop dressing that way.
E_Pluribus_Venom	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	399	Yes, it is possible for two people to have an off opinion.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	Well, there are a few dirty little secrets that nobody wants to think about.First, securing air travel from terrorism is basically impossible no matter how much money or technology or profiling or anything we do.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	9/11 was executed with boxcutters.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	There are 30 million flights a year in the US.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	No way we can keep something as simple as boxcutters off the planes, no way we can anticipate who is and who isn't going to be a terrorist with a high degree of accuracy.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	Not on 30 million flights with something like 2.4 billion passengers a year.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	Somebody at TSA leaked an internal memo detailing tests they did of the security a few years ago and they found that they were able to get an actual firearm through security over 60&#37; of the time just by packing it in a carry on with a few power cords obscuring the shape or by disassembling it into two parts...
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	Besides, five guys who are thoroughly trained in martial arts could probably take over a plane with no weapons anyways.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	Making air travel completely secure just can't be done.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	Even if we totally went nuts and said you can't bring anything on a plane at all, nobody we know to be a muslim can fly at all, and nobody who is middle eastern can fly, it still wouldn't be sucure.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	They'd just need to find a few asian, black or white people who have the kind of training you need to take over a plane with your bare hands to act as their agents.Second, if you look at brass tacks- lives saved per dollar spent, airport security is about the worst possible way to save lives in the US.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	In the last 10 years we've lost about 5,000 lives to terrorism.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	And that number is WAY higher than what we would expect normally because the WTC was an outrageous 'stroke of luck' for Al Qaeda.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	Nobody expected that the entire buildings would go down.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	But, even if we just take that figure- 500 lives a year is the most we could possibly save if our airport security were perfect.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	We spent about $10 billion/year on airport security.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	So, even if at our current budget level airport security were suddenly absolutely foolproof and we really saved 500 lives every year, saving each of those lives costs us $20 million per.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	Now, everybody says that you can't put a price on a life, and emotionally that's certainly true, but the fiscal reality is that they have to.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	If they're weighing say cancer research against airport security, the odds are pretty good that in the long run $10 billion spent on cancer research will save thousands of times as many lives as one year of airport security would.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	Politically nobody wants to say that out loud, no politician wants to seem 'soft on terror', a terrorist attack could kill a politician's career.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	But the hard nosed policy makers are definitely pointing that out behind closed doors.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	Spending still more money on airport security isn't really a pragmatic move if your goal is to save as many lives as you can with a fixed budget.Thirdly, even if we did completely secure air travel somehow, that wouldn't really reduce casualties.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	Actually a terrorist attacking a plane is one of the 'better' alternatives for us.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	Bombing, for example, a sports arena during a major event would have dramatically more casualties than the typical airplane terrorism.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	If air travel were 100% secure, Al Qaeda wouldn't just go home and call it a day, they'd pick other approaches, which may well end up just as bad or worse for us.Fourth, air travel is already extremely safe.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	The odds that you will die because of terrorism any given time you take a flight are 1 in 4.8 million.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	It seems a lot riskier than that to people because when a plane does get attacked, it's such huge news, but the actual risk you're taking each time you fly is lower than the risk that you'll be crushed by a vending machine in any give year.
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	To some extent, part of the solution is to worry about it less than we do.Anyways, I know all that sounds really calous...
teamosil	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	400	But I think that's the reality of why neither party is actually pushing for huge increases in airport security.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	401	LOL - thats why I said IF its such an important issue ... more planes fall out of the sky because of engine failure than get blown up in a terrorist attack, and more people die from numerous other causes ... its really not money well spent.obviously, intelligence, rather than profiling, is more likely to be effective at preventing attack - but if airport security is seen as the solution - than general scanning of ALL would be the way to go rather than profiling.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	401	there will always be ways to get around that.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	401	although if community safety is really the issue there are countless other things which need the money, or better practices implemented, where more actual lives could be saved than by using either profiling or scanning.I suspect the whole profiling argument is about being seen to do something in response to the anti Muslim hysteria that every little incident generates.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	401	profiling if tageting targeting muslims, would unfortunately, be applauded by a significant number of people, even if proven to have no actual safety benefit.
E_Pluribus_Venom	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	402	It's just political appeasement in the form of constituent demand (even if it's completely ridiculous).
E_Pluribus_Venom	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	402	What a stupid terrorist a terrorist would be to actually fall within the criteria some of these advocates have listed.

stroll	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	403	I've always thought it was a bit of a joke, like they take my wife's manicure set away, as if she could hi-jack the plane with a nail file...lolBut if you book business or first class, you get metal cutlery and proper glasses with your food.
stroll	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	403	Easy enough to sharpen a knife on the toilet with sand-paper or break a glass/bottle.
teamosil	stroll	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	404	Yeah.
teamosil	stroll	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	404	The truth is that they're taking away her nail file because they want to make her feel safer to know that we have strict security, not because it actually makes the plane safer.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	Agreed, +75% (my professional guesstimate) of the present security rules are for show.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	They give the appearance that our government is &quot;on the job&quot;.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	This actually does have value since it brings people out of their shells (homes) and out into the public to spend money.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	No spending, no economic movement.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	Remember the September 27th, 2001 speech when the President said &quot;Get on board; do your business around the country; fly and enjoy America's great destination spots; get down to Disney World in Florida; take your families and enjoy life the way we want it to be enjoyed''?Face it, many people are wimps.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	They're afraid of getting hurt.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	This is expected since most, way too many for my taste, have never served a day in the military.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	They're sheep.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	Nothing wrong with that, but it explains why the sheepdogs do what they do.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	I really enjoyed your summation, teamosil.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	It was very accurate.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	However, I do have some points to add or disagree.First, while we can never absolutely guarantee there won't be terrorist attack onboard an airliner, we can improve the safety and security of the flights in direct inverse correlation to allowing the passengers their rights guaranteed under the Constitution of the United States of America.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	By turning the USA into a police state, we can increase security....and become less American by doing so.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	Ben Franklin's quote on the matter comes to mind.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	By doing so, the terrorists do indeed win because they've successfully caused Americans to become so terrified they are no longer Americans.Second, Agreed it isn't cost effective.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	Agreed this is how our government and the public think; putting a value on people's lives.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	We all give lip-service to statements like &quot;Life is sacred&quot; or &quot;You can't put a price on life&quot;, but the sad fact is we do put a value on human life everyday whether it's about reforming health care or improving airport security.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	Currently the FAA places a value of $2.7 million on every passenger.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	If the cost of security exceeds this figure, then that particular security procedure/system/improvement/whatever isn't used.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	However, while a capitalistic/materialistic culture does place a value on human life, I think we demean ourselves when we do it.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	I understand why we do it, but as Mr. Rico said, &quot;Men are not potatoes&quot;.Third, agreed.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	405	The terrorists wouldn't quit, they'd just adapt as they've done in Europe with trains and buses or go outside the aircraft with Manpads, switch to cargo aircraft or induce a mid-air from another aircraft.Fouth, agreed, but good luck convincing the sheep of it.
teamosil	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	406	Good points.
teamosil	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	406	Yeah.
teamosil	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	406	And the worst part is that they fear all the wrong ways to get hurt.
teamosil	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	406	For example, one of the things many parents are terrified of and constantly on gaurd against is having their child kidnapped by a stranger.
teamosil	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	406	They curtail their kids' freedom dramatically to prevent it and they teach their kids to fear strangers.
teamosil	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	406	But, only about 100 kids are kidnapped by strangers in the US each year.
teamosil	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	406	That sounds like a lot at first, but that's only a on in a million chance that your kid will get kidnapped by a stranger.
teamosil	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	406	In fact, a kid is around 1,000 times more likely to be kidnapped by a member of his immediate family than by a stranger, and around 600 times more likely to die by drinking household cleaning supplies and around 2,000 times more likely to be physically or sexually abused by a member of the family.
teamosil	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	406	Those are the sorts of things people ought to worry about with kids, not strangers.
teamosil	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	406	If you really want to keep your kid as safe as possible, you would start by making sure that everything in the house that could potentially be poisonous is completely inaccessible to a child, you would make sure that any guns in the house are locked up, have trigger locks, are unloaded, and that the ammunition is locked up in another place, you would learn anger management techniques if you have any problem at all with your temper, you wouldn't get wasted around the kid, each parent would independantly make it absolutely clear to the kid that he would never be in trouble for telling people if anybody molested them, even themselves or their spouse, etc...
teamosil	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	406	Way too often you see families that have cleaning chemicals under the sink, a gun and ammo just unlocked with kids around, with problematic tempers and whatnot who won't let their kids play out in the front yard alone...The same thing happens across most issues.
teamosil	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	406	People incorrectly fear violence from a stranger more than the radically more likely scenario of being attacked by your friends or family, people fear terrorism more than auto accidents, people worry more about bird flu than heart disease, etc. I don't know if we just watch too much TV or what, but we seem hyper aware of dangers that make exciting plots for movies and almost oblivious to real world dangers that are infinitely more common, but not as exciting...
wyly	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	407	very sensible post Tea...I was all for banning muslims from flying but I've come back to sanity after you're post(most excellent)...still I don't like flying mostly because having my life in someone's control(the pilot) makes me uneasy...adding to that someone idiot unknown to me would want to to do me in for some religious issue beyond my control...
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	408	An excellent point.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	408	Here's one link about unreasonable fears: http://www.newsweek.com/id/78178I remember reading one statistic about how 40,000 Americans die each year in automobile accidents.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	408	That's equal to two fully-loaded 747s crashing each week!
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	408	Yet, people go bonkers every time there is an aircraft accident which injures or kills a few people but they don't bat an eye when 20 people die during a holiday weekend.
RPA1	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	409	Explain why you would not profile a Muslim-looking male in that age range.
RPA1	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	409	You wouldn't profile this guy?
Divine Wind	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	410	So you believe the best security policy is to profile all the &quot;swarthy&quot; looking people and letting people like this guy go right onboard unprofiled?
Divine Wind	DutchClogCyborg	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	412	Agreed.
Divine Wind	DutchClogCyborg	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	412	That's behavioral profiling.
Divine Wind	DutchClogCyborg	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	412	A person who has traveled alone to suspect countries such as Yemen, stayed for weeks with no accountability of what they were doing then buys a one-way ticket to New York is the person I'd like to see given a more thorough review....I don't care what they look like.
Divine Wind	DutchClogCyborg	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	412	Looks can be deceiving.
RPA1	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	414	And if that information was not available and a young 'swarthy' male carrying a Quran was fiddling with something in his pants you would ignore him on the basis of a fear of being racist?
Divine Wind	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	416	I'd inspect anyone who acted suspicious regardless of race....including the white guy.Behavioral profiling is superior to racial profiling.
RPA1	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	418	Me too however, the PC crowd gets up in arms and cries discrimination if you happen to profile the wrong race, religion etc. or claims a violation of rights....as evidenced in this very thread and by the fact that there is controversy over using full body scanners by 'civil rights advocates.'
RPA1	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	418	We are so 'PC' we can't even protect ourselves adequately anymore.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	419	Of course not... but when people start talking about singling out people of middle eastern descent with typical muslim garb (i.e. turbans, hijab) or individuals with common arab names, it becomes clear that a diverse religion isn't really the focus.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	420	It's not.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	420	But since you cannot tell an extreme Muslim from a &quot;regular&quot; Muslim at an airport, and one wants to blow up my plane, just check them both closely and move on.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	420	No harm.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	420	No foul.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	420	No explosion.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	420	The prize here is not the World Tolerance Award.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	420	It's stopping a plane from blowing up.
stekim	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	420	And since no one except Muslim extremists has tried to blow planes up, it seems logical to do a little profiling.
SpankyTheWhale	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	421	I think the real solution is to imitate Israel's system as closely as possible.
E_Pluribus_Venom	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	422	Allow me to alter that...
Divine Wind	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	423	Uh, no.
Divine Wind	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	423	They only become upset when someone continually states that it isn't about race then posts a picture and says &quot;You wouldn't profile this guy?&quot;
Divine Wind	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	424	The problem isn't &quot;profiling&quot;, it's what kind of profiling.
Divine Wind	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	424	Do you think racial profiling is 1) Constitutional and 2) going to make us safer or do you think behavioral profiling would be better on both counts?
RPA1	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	425	Why?
RPA1	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	425	What 'race' is that guy anyway?
RPA1	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	425	Never thought about it.
RPA1	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	425	Until now.
RPA1	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	426	1) Yes police do this all the time and 2) Yes it does make us safer.
RPA1	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	426	Example: Police have a lead on a known white guy bomber....Would you advocate (not wanting to be racist) searching for a black guy ?
wyly	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	427	hmm Hitlers people tried to blow him out of the air with a bomb...an american I believe was the first to blow up a passenger plane to collect insurance on family members...a Cuban/american CIA operative blew a Cuban airliner out of the sky the USA still refuses to hand him over...
wyly	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	427	Canadians blew up an Air India plane killing over 300....
Divine Wind	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	428	Suuure you did.
Divine Wind	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	428	Did you support David Duke when he said he wasn't a racist, that he fully supported every person's right to preserve their racial heritage?
stroll	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	429	Nonsense, this would be suspicious behaviour, regardless of religion or race.You seem to have a bee in your bonnet about &quot;being racist&quot;, I wonder if you even know what this is.
stroll	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	429	What's this gibberish?
stroll	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	429	A specific case where a person of certain characteristics is known to carry a bomb is hardly comparable to racial/religious profiling at airports.
cassandrabandra	Latherty	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	430	in a nutshell - you've summed up the reason why profiling is not only a waste of time, but also counterproductive in the long term.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	431	bingo.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	431	its about image - not security.look - we ARE doing something - feel safe.

cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	431	but it looks good.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	432	real world common sense, based on factual information - is rare.
cassandrabandra	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	432	security and safety decisions SHOULD be based on risk assessment, however it seems there is an increasing tendency for these to be made based on public hysteria.
stroll	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	433	It has been proposed to apply stricter controls on people simply because of their religion, regardless of anything else which may raise suspicions or not.This is unconstitutional in the US, and pointing out the inadequacy of such policy has nothing to do with any &quot;PC crowd&quot;.
Divine Wind	stroll	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	434	Exactly.
Divine Wind	stroll	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	434	Strategically, it is also stupid to turn the threat of a few thousand religious fundamentalist ass clowns into a Billion people with a reason to treat us the same way some are advocating they be treated; with disrespect, distrust, less than human and thoroughly without American principles of justice.
Matticus77	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	435	And why should we respect or trust those whose nation allows those thousands of fundamentalist live free?

cassandrabandra	Kman	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	455	do we need to update our passports every six months, or every time we plan to go travelling in case we have converted since our passports were issued previously?

Divine Wind	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	474	It violates every principle this country stands for.

Hard-Driver	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	475	Whites make up 74% of the population.
Hard-Driver	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	475	And if you factor in driving, since many minorities live in cities where they drive less or use public transportation, my guess is that Caucasians do about 87% of the driving.
Hard-Driver	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	475	There is no statistical justification for your statement.
Hard-Driver	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	475	However, let me ask you some questions, what percentage of airline passengers are foreign muslims in the USA or flights to and from the USA?
Hard-Driver	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	475	Probably a pretty low percentage.
Hard-Driver	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	475	I don't know this number, but a wild guess would be less than 5% What percentage of terrorists on airplanes in the USA or flying into the USA are foreign muslims, 100%.
Hard-Driver	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	475	So if less than 5% of passengers create 100% of the terrorists, then does it not make sense to give that 5% of passengers more scrutiney.
Hard-Driver	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	475	So it would be more like asking a question, if only deer ticks carry lime disease, and you want to test for lime disease, do you only test deer ticks, or do you waste time, effort and resources testing all variety of ticks in case there is a new form of the disease that has spread?
Hard-Driver	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	475	How many families with children have commited airline terrorism?

Hard-Driver	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	475	Yet families with children still get searched.
Hard-Driver	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	475	I am not saying that families with children should get no screening.
Hard-Driver	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	475	But I do think that a little profiling of who gets a closer look is reasonable.
Divine Wind	Hard-Driver	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	476	Our security forces are profiling, they just aren't using skin color, a number tattooed on a forearm or a patch sewn on the passenger's jacket as a basis for determining who is searched and who gets a walk.
Divine Wind	Hard-Driver	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	476	Since I'm in the business, I fully understand the errors in our security system, where the holes are and also the inanities or injustices.
Divine Wind	Hard-Driver	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	476	Racial profiling isn't the way to go for more than the reason it's unAmerican, but because all it will do is force a change in tactics.

stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	479	But yes, by all means let's learn what we can and do what we can.
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	479	But in the end the whole Christmas day incident came down to simply searching the guy!
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	479	Nothing high tech about that.
Divine Wind	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	480	It's already been done once for a couple years.
Divine Wind	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	480	Don't you remember?
Divine Wind	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	480	The problem is a certain President needed to send those troops elsewhere.
Divine Wind	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	480	Got news for you, they already have.
Divine Wind	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	480	Do you understand the dynamics of how these bombs work and what circumstances make their use most effective?
Divine Wind	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	480	Why not?
SpankyTheWhale	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	481	Possibly not, but why?
SpankyTheWhale	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	481	Why not.
SpankyTheWhale	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	481	It seems very efficient, and 007 cool.
SpankyTheWhale	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	481	What is so bad abotu TSA employees?
SpankyTheWhale	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	481	Why can't we learn to copy or adapt Israel's system so that our system and theirs is at least basically the same?
SpankyTheWhale	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	481	Searching the guy surely would have worked, but that is only a solution for a terrorist who has already gotten through the line at the airport.
SpankyTheWhale	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	481	If the information gathered by the intelligence community was acted upon, nobody would even know that anything was going to happen at all.
SpankyTheWhale	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	481	If they had Israeli-style security at the airport, should he have gotten that far, they would have known at many different checkpoints before he would have gotten far enough for a search, and that pretty much means immediately.

stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	They are allowed to search you at an airport, but the rules can be rather strict.
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	For good reason, by the way.
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	But the measures you can take in one country may not apply in another.

stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	We don't have it.
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	You don't fly much, do you?
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	Not meant as an insult.
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	It's just that if you flew a lot like I do you would not ask that question.
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	Sort of like someone who rides a bike asking, &quot;What's wrong with the DMV&quot;.
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	Like I said, whatever we can do is fine.
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	But they profile.
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	Don't pretend for a second they don't.
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	True.
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	But it DOES work.
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	That's why I don't like relying solely on intelligence!
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	We see how it fails over and over again.
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	As for the second part, it's not likely.
stekim	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	482	The European Union has rules more strict than ours for what's allowed at an airport in regard to searches and the like.
SpankyTheWhale	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	483	I have flown a handful of times since 9/11/01, and a couple of those times were between countries outside of the United States.
SpankyTheWhale	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	483	Can you enlighten me?
SpankyTheWhale	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	483	They don't simply profile, like we are talking about in this thread.
SpankyTheWhale	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	483	They are more efficient and discreet about it, and they use other methods that enable them to get at the terrorists directly, whether or not they typically happen to be Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, or another Jewish Israeli.
SpankyTheWhale	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	483	A lot of things work that are not the right way to go.
SpankyTheWhale	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	483	If intelligence was better, in very obvious and simple ways, we wouldn't have to worry about profiling at the airport.
SpankyTheWhale	stekim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	483	However, the security at the airport could be improved as well, so I do not advocate relying solely on intelligence..

.daniel	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	517	Males ages 18-25 originating from countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Syria, etc. with middle to upper middle class backgrounds and exposure to Mosques related to extremism would be a decent working profile for a moderate percentage of the terrorists that have attacked or attempted to attack the United States.
.daniel	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	517	Guesstimating, I'd say about 65% or more fit that profile.
.daniel	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	517	The rest were domestic terrorists, such as Timothy McVeigh, or home-grown radical Muslims that do not fit the age or nationality factors, though income levels and sex seem to indicate middle class to upper middle class males.I would also like to note that I never divulged which decision I had come to, had I?
.daniel	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	517	I simply stated my two conflicting opinions on the issue.

SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	523	Yeah.
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	523	It's a Muslim.
Agent Zero	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	524	If you want to have a serious discussion, please do so.
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	525	I've already posted my solution.
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	525	We need to set up Israeli-style security at airports, and it wouldn't hurt to copy the Israeli style of intelligence collecting, either.
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	525	Apparently we need to train special police forces, so that military soldiers are not stationed in civilian zones (martial law, you know?), and we need to replace the TSA employees, because apparently they are Neanderthals.
Divine Wind	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	526	Maybe in Europe, but that just shows how the Euro's need to grow a pair of brass ones and get involved in tracking down the terrorists instead of sitting back, letting the United States do it and then whining about American hegemony.
Divine Wind	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	526	Also, if you were in America, you'd know our future is both Hispanic and, consequently, Catholic.

SpankyTheWhale	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	527	Mexicans are not interested in terrorism on planes.
SpankyTheWhale	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	527	It is just Muslims.(Mexicans really aren't interested in terrorism at all.
SpankyTheWhale	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	527	They are interested in invading and recapturing the southwest.)
Divine Wind	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	528	How do you know they won't take an interest in terrorism to attain that goal?

SpankyTheWhale	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	530	They've already got a system that is working.

Agent Zero	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	532	Can you debunk the numerous instances of terrorism not carried out by Muslims?
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	533	I thought you were saying that Mexicans hijack planes too.

cassandrabandra	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	535	So why is Cuba on the list of 14 countries?Serious question.
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	536	Nah, no Latinos hijack American planes or planes heading to or from America.
Agent Zero	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	537	You're moving the goal posts.
Agent Zero	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	537	Your original contention, which I quoted, did not specify the U.S.
SpankyTheWhale	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	538	Cuba is not Mexico.We've had a more than rocky diplomatic relationship with Cuba for 50 years.
SpankyTheWhale	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	538	We can't import cigars from Cuba, either, and supposedly, Cuban cigars are the best cigars you can get.
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	539	I thought that this whole thread implied the US.
Agent Zero	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	541	There's no such thing implied in either the OP nor the poll.
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	542	&quot;We&quot;&quot;Should We Profile?&quot;
cassandrabandra	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	543	are Cubans Latinos?
SpankyTheWhale	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	544	Well, my statement is still correct.
SpankyTheWhale	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	544	Cuba's place on the list was either earned due to our overall diplomatic relationship with them or due to some reason I'm not aware of, or due to the imperfection that the security system is known to have.
cassandrabandra	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	545	Or due to poor diplomatic relations, they are able to take their place in the group as the token &quot;non Muslims&quot; to show the US isn't being discriminatory against Muslims?shows what a joke the whole thing is IMO.its knee jerk reactionary stuff - so that a terrorist with a nice English sounding name, a western passport and a journey originating in a western country can still bypass security, while a Muslim woman from Saudi Arabia, heading to the USA to study a higher degree in nursing, will get patted down just because of where she comes from.how can anyone seriously think this is about security?
SpankyTheWhale	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	546	It's quite the opposite.
SpankyTheWhale	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	546	The clear reality of the situation is that white Americans who cannot possibly be thought of as suspects for terrorism are harassed while terrorists pass through as Muslims are disabused of such processes in the name of fairness.
Agent Zero	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	547	Why can't white Americans be possible suspects?
Agent Zero	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	547	Was Richard Reid an Arab?
Agent Zero	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	547	No, he was...ding ding ding!...a white guy!
Agent Zero	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	547	Yes, he converted, but who would know it?The xenophobia is showing.
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	548	The white Americans they search cannot possibly be suspects.
Agent Zero	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	549	And why not?
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	550	Because they are just kids and parents and grandparents.
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	550	They are Americans.
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	550	And they are not Muslims.
Agent Zero	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	551	There are no Muslim Americans?
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	552	Of course there are Muslim Americans.
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	552	They comprise something like 2% of the population.
Agent Zero	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	553	So what was your prior post intended to mean?
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	554	I am saying that nonMuslim Americans are almost guaranteed to be innocent.
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	554	Muslim Americans are still almost guaranteed to be innocent.
SpankyTheWhale	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	554	nonAmerican Muslims, or American Muslims influenced by foreign sources, are whom we have to look at.
cassandrabandra	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	555	ALMOST.Muslim Americans (and most other Muslims) can also ALMOST be guaranteed to be innocent.
cassandrabandra	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	555	I can't imagine that any of the Muslims I have met - regardless of country of origin - being a supporter of Al Qaeda, much less being prepared to be a suicide bomber.It is just plain WRONG to victimize these people, and its not even sensible use of resources.
cassandrabandra	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	555	Americans have a better chance of being killed by a white American male with a gun than by a hijab wearing Muslim woman from the middle east.
SpankyTheWhale	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	556	No other people should be inconvenienced.
SpankyTheWhale	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	556	It looks like we should narrow our focus instead of expanding it to include children with toothpaste.
cassandrabandra	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	557	And a woman from Nigeria on a student visa?
cassandrabandra	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	557	why should she be targeted?
Divine Wind	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	558	Which is why, if I were a terrorist or drug smuggler, I'd be finding ways to have kids carrying my supplies through security.
Divine Wind	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	558	It's not that difficult given one has the time and the cash.

Red	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	564	And passengers from those places can change planes at Schipol, too.
Red	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	564	Obviously you don't care about Belfast, or else you'd be bombing the place, but the question is - can you really afford to profile African Muslims with Western educations who may well have been &quot;radicalised&quot; in Yemen while dissident Republicans come and go freely?
SpankyTheWhale	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	565	The Irish Republicans DO only care about their Island.

cassandrabandra	changed	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	581	perhaps if America did not present itself as playing such an important role in promoting democracy around the wolrd, people would be less interested in how it introduces policies for the purpose of discrimination against certain groups.in any case - profiling is an illogical use of resources, as well as being discriminatory.

cassandrabandra	changed	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	581	when looking at reducing risk in any environment - professionals take into account a range of factors which can eliminate the risk or control the likelihood of an event occurring.

cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	592	really?are you saying that the people killed in almost 200 Tamil Tiger suicide bombings were not innocent civilians?In addition, we know that, compared to the total number of all suicide attacks, the percentage carried out by Muslims is proportionately less than the proportion of mass shootings of innocent people carried out by young males who show a strong interest in guns.should we profile young males who show an interest in guns?and I'll ask you again - exactly HOW do you propose this profiling of all Muslims to be carried out?
calm2chaos	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	593	You seem intent on comparing a terrorsit and a common criminal, breaking civil law in the country he/she lives.
calm2chaos	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	593	Not the truth, the people we are talking about bomb innocents enmass in both there own countries and abroad.
calm2chaos	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	593	I don't understand your desire to try and frame terrorist as just a common everday run of the mill criminal, they are not.Secondly I never said all muslims.
calm2chaos	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	593	I said
cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	594	1.
cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	594	Tamil Tigers are not muslims, but until the invasion of Iraq, were responsible for more suicide bombings than any other group.2.
cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	594	the reason why profiling is proposed in the first instance, is to protect innocent people.
cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	594	Inside the US, since 12 September 2001, more innocent people have been killed by mass shooters than by terrorists.
cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	594	if protecting innocent people is the purpose, profiling may be sensible in a variety of situations.3.
cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	594	How do we know who is a Muslim?
cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	594	As to the rest of your post, we are probably more on the same page than you realize.
cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	594	I have been in plenty of airports over the last few years, and have travelled in regions where terrorist attacks are not unknown.
cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	594	I have been in bus stations and airports where all people entering, and all luggage is scanned as you enter the building - not just when you re boarding the plane, I have been on buses stopped by soldiers, where passengers have to provide ID, and baggage is searched.In these circumstances, the security measures are seen as reasonable by some, an intrusion by others, and just par for the course by the majority.
cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	594	And in that part of the world - where there is a higher risk of terrorist activity, it makes sense.however, here in the west we are at far less risk.
cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	594	It is not impossible, however the most effective preventative is intelligence - and in particular the communication of that intelligence.
cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	594	I don't mind being the middle aged obviously non Muslim woman who gets randomly searched - which has happened at least four times - I understand why they do this, but I don't see why a young Muslim woman with a baby should be regarded as more of a threat than me, or why a Muslim student who is returning to his home country after receiving news of a family tragedy should be singled out for extra special attention and interrogation, causing him to miss a plane ...we need intelligence at every level.
cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	594	it is more effective at preventing terrorism than any other strategy.
cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	594	profiling is a way of looking like you are doing something, when actually you just telling the terrorists that they need to find other methods to kill innocent civilians.

calm2chaos	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	596	And my concern is for flights and routes into the US.
calm2chaos	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	596	Although I would imagine other countries may feel roughly the same.
calm2chaos	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	596	Again I don't understand the point in comparing a common criminal to a terrorist.
calm2chaos	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	596	But what your saying is took the common criminal you specified a DECADE or so to match the kill ratio of terrosit in a single day.
calm2chaos	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	596	By the way are we talking world wide or just in the US?

calm2chaos	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	596	The majority of the people will say muslim = arab, which for the arguement/discussion we are having is partly true.
calm2chaos	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	596	But lets face it there are a billion muslims of every race and creed and they are going to have the upper hand if they decide to strap on the vest to win there 70 annoying ass virgins.
calm2chaos	cassandrabandra	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	596	Which makes no sense.

cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	598	its just evidence that suicide bombing is NOT an exclusively Muslim phenomenon.
cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	598	and if its not - then maybe we need to rethink a few ideas we have about the motives for suicide bombing.
cassandrabandra	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	598	at the end of the day, its about protecting innocent lives.

Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	The day after the Deansgate bombing in Manchester I tried to get into work (this was before the modern &quot;Business Continuity&quot; systems which send text alerts to everyone and all that jazz).
Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	I was turned back by armed police and went to a cafe for breakfast, where I tried not to meet the eye of a drunk bloke (this was before 8:00) wanting to make conversation, but failed.
Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	He had a Belfast accent you could cut with a knife.So?
Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	Did ye hear about the bomb yesterday?Aye, I was caught up in it.Terrible business.
Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	Do you know what happened to me? Shall I tell ye?
Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	Shall I tell ye what...Please do.The polis stopped me. Me! Can ye believe it?
Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	They thought I might be a terrorist.
Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	I don't know why they don't just stop people who look like terrorists.I hadn't realised it was that simple.
Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	What does a terrorist look like?Sure, and have ye not seen them on the television?
Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	Ugly and stupid-looking...I might have said (but didn't) that my interlocutor was as ugly and stupid-looking an Ulsterman as I've ever met, but should have been ruled out of the police investigation on the grounds that proper terrorists don't hang around for hours after the bombing, getting drunk at breakfast time.Or, do they?
Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	Staggering about like a sad wino might be the perfect cover.Shortly afterwards I moved to London, which was still reeling from the Bishopsgate Bombing.
Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	They had instituted a &quot;Ring of Steel&quot; around the financial district, which was basically a perimeter of armed police stopping people at random according to whether they &quot;looked suspicious&quot;.
Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	Now, I may have a strong North-Eastern English accent, but until I open my mouth I'm the most Irish-looking bugger imaginable - my own cigarette-end gives me sunburn, I visibly freckle as the sun rises in winter.
Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	Wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase, I sailed past the Ring of Steel (on Tower Bridge!
Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	Yes, all Brits walk across Tower Bridge as part of their daily commute, it's true) without ever once being questioned.
Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	But, as we often said to each other at the time, if the Provos had thought they could get a car-bomb into the City of London in a BMW driven by a black man, then they should think again.Profiling?
Red	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	599	My arse.

Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	650	How is a comment like the above supposed to make America better?
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	650	It isn't.
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	650	It's merely tossed in to incite anger among Americans or to allow the poster to feel self-righteous.
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	650	It's not checks which are being suggested as much as the checks which are already agreed upon which weren't done.
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	650	Of course, we've got our own problems too with being able to put together facts which were already known so there is plenty of blame to go around.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	651	This may be an instance of our two peoples being divided by a common language.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	651	The word &quot;daft&quot; is a very mild one, you know, such as you might use about the behaviour of a stranger's children right in front of him without expecting any sort of confrontation.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	651	I thought it to be entirely proportionate in response to someone announcing that they are sick of foreigners who should keep their noses out.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	651	And I still do.I happened to notice that on another thread, where I had stated (as a matter of plain fact, no more) that it would be illegal to train &quot;jihadist children&quot; in camps in the UK, you leapt in to observe that we have our stiff upper lips up our arses.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	651	That's a disturbing mixed metaphor which may be considered polite conversation where you come from, but I doubt it.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	651	Now look, you are entitled to comment that the United Kingdom should legalise the weapons training of children, I only remarked that there's no need to worry that (as had been suggested) there might be too much of it going on, as things stand in the real-life UK.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	651	I guess that you took that as implicit criticism of your own unregulated gun culture, and lashed out?
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	651	Then, some hours later I remarked that, although I find some things in America &quot;daft&quot; I haven't seen any of them attacked on this thread, and I'm &quot;inciting anger&quot;?
Matt	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	652	No but I am not sure why.
Matt	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	652	Many Americans would claim they are &quot;losing freedoms&quot;.
Matt	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	652	But think about it, are we really?
Matt	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	652	I say no.
Matt	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	652	Your still allowed to do the exact same thing in the exact same way, you just may have to breathe into a machine first, its really not that big of a deal.
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	653	I could accept that if it were true, but that isn't what you said or were doing.
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	653	You made a general statement about what things Americans prohibit or promote.
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	653	Nice try at a dodge, however.
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	653	Daft is an Old English-derived word for silly, stupid, or mad, depending on context.
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	653	Are you serious?
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	653	Is this an intentional misrepresentation of the truth or do you not really understand your own words?
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	653	You said:
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	653	...and I responded that that attitude was one of the reasons we kicked the Red Coats back across the pond.
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	653	What you do in England is your business but making a blanket statement that teaching kids to shoot is wrong reeks of what was worst about British autocratic attitudes.
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	653	Have nice day.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	654	So, in this context, &quot;silly&quot;.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	654	And there is my &quot;dodge&quot; for all to see - I simply commented that requiring foreigners not to denigrate (unspecified) things about one's own country as &quot;daft&quot; is one thing, but asking foreigners to stay out of a discussion about international agreements is quite another.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	654	Now, may I crave your honour's pardon for mentioning in passing that there happens to be an aspect of life in my country with which I don't disagree?
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	654	You will recall, I hope, that there had been an exchange of views about what kind of terrorist training (alleged, unnamed) tweeny jihadists might receive in the country where I live, and the point of my post was to inform you all that they couldn't possibly get any such training.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	654	And I &quot;autocratically&quot; remarked that this was just as well?
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	654	Now, look, if you want to deprive your own teenagers - autocratically - of their rights to (for example) have a beer and go to bed together, then I promise not to get on your case about it.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	654	Although I will insist on my right to use the &quot;da_t word&quot; about such measures as and when I bloody well choose to use it, Sir, I will not start any sort of campaign to extend the rights our teenagers enjoy already to your oppressed teenagers.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	654	I mean, we didn't come over to your country and abolish slavery, did we (note to self, remember to delete this remark before submitting the post).
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	654	All I have done is to observe that one cannot talk about &quot;profiling&quot; transatlantic air-travellers unilaterally, and that one cannot accuse the United Kingdom of being too lax in giving weapons training to &quot;jihadist&quot; tweenies.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	654	Accuse some other country, where they have guns.
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	655	LOL.
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	655	No, but since you persist on this charade when everyone else can read your own words, it's best they just read your own words:
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	655	Another case of you attempting to whitewash over what your own words convey best:
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	655	This is flat statement.
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	655	Although you did go on to say there'd be penalties if it were to occur in the UK, the initial statement was unencumbered by borders, cultures or geography.
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	655	See, that's what I was talkin' about.
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	655	Americans, we're just ordinary folks.
Divine Wind	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	655	When we kicked out the Red Coats, we also kicked out all that high falutin' aristocratic monarchy-lovin' talk like &quot;your honour's&quot;, &quot;my Lord&quot; and &quot;G'day Guv'nor&quot;.

E_Pluribus_Venom	Matt	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	663	Because you create a police state.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Matt	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	663	With the acceptance of profiling comes the disregard for &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; as well as probable cause.
E_Pluribus_Venom	Matt	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	663	Forget a loss of freedom... a loss of rights is a more accurate rebuttal.
Matt	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	664	What right have we lost?
Matt	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	664	You said &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot;, I disagree.
Matt	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	664	We would still have that right.

Matt	E_Pluribus_Venom	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	664	I am not saying I think they should impose it, I am just saying I wouldn't complain if they did.

teamosil	Matt	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	666	Religious profiling violates the 1st, 5th and 14th ammendments- freedom of religion, due process and equal protection.Edit: Good point EPV, it violates the 4th as well- freedom from unreasonable searches
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	667	Agreed.
Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	667	Unfortunately, we see to have several people who are willing to shred the Constitution to protect themselves.

Divine Wind	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	667	We shouldn't give them up so easily simply to have the illusion of security.

stroll	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	670	It's because the French are extreme leftist and don't want terrorists to be profiled - just like the liberals in the US.
calm2chaos	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	671	Our ancestors also shot first and asked questions later.

Divine Wind	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	672	Not the smartest way to go, but we did learn from out mistakes.
Divine Wind	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	672	Well, some of us did.
Divine Wind	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	672	Point taken about the Indians, but that isn't what I meant.
Divine Wind	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	672	The &quot;pioneer spirit&quot; I'm talking about is a willingness to take a risk to make a better life.
Divine Wind	calm2chaos	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	672	It took a lot of guts to hop a rickety boat for a two month ride across the Atlantic to an uncertain future.

Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	674	Don't forget that your thought experiment would entail a most terrible emmiseration of Momma's peasant community, so that life there is so tenuous and desperate that her children would actively choose to sink all their resources into a steerage ticket to the New World, with its intimidating climate and wildlife, and nascent infrastructure etc.I mean, &quot;pioneers&quot; weren't exactly press-ganged, were they?
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	674	It wasn't &quot;Free farmland or death&quot;, it was &quot;Free farmland or - suit yourself...&quot;.

Jollee	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	678	I think it should be one factor but mostly where they have been and where they are going....As we know terrorist can come in all different packages....
Divine Wind	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	679	Exactly correct.
Divine Wind	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	679	That's called Behavioral Profiling as opposed to racial profiling where all &quot;furriner's&quot; are pulled aside for special handling while all the white folk are left unhindered.
Divine Wind	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	679	In order to win this war we need to smarter than the enemy, not more fearful.

dk_tv	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	683	I would simply just pay the baggage handlers like everyone else in this country does.On the subject of terrorism, there is all these crazy security measures at Sydney/Brisbane/Auckland airports....but my plane from Wagga Wagga, I just go to the small counter without my ticket and say my name....wait 20mins....walk through the doors.... walk about 20m.... and board.....no security at all!
dk_tv	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	683	haha seriously its a joke.

Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	685	The problem with this &quot;Behavioural Profiling&quot; is that it can only hope to catch the stupid ones.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	685	We have to remember that the &quot;underpants bomber&quot;, like the &quot;shoe bomber&quot; before him, was not only stupid enough to broadcast all sorts of danger-signs re luggage, travel plans etc, but was also too stupid to detonate explosives.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	685	Has anyone who actually succeeded in causing an explosion, in committing mass-murder, also left clues which we kick ourselves for having missed - even with 20/20 hindsight?
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	685	Not that I can think of.

Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	685	God knows, I do that, and have lost some nice Swiss Army knives that I'd simply forgotten to take out of my pocket in consequence.And that is the only consequence.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	685	Security guards looked daggers at me, as though their day had been more ruined by the confiscation of my Christmas present than had my own, but that's all.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	685	I just failed to find the Guardian article I was looking for, but I recall reading one by a security expert whose line was that we simply have to prosecute, or otherwise penalise, obviously innocent people far more than we do now, if any of these security measures is seriously intended.Soft drinks were exactly the example he used.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	685	We're reminded, then urged, then adjured to discard our pop bottles and water bottles as we progress toward the security gate and then, if they find a bottle of Evian on you, they give you a dirty look and put it in a big bin with all the hundreds of other half-empty bottles.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	685	Is that dirty look really supposed to deter a person intent on blowing up the whole flight?
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	685	Because it wasn't even enough to remind me to pack properly, or to remind &quot;dk_tv&quot; to neck his pop before check-in.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	685	We should have been prosecuted, we should at least have missed our flights.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	685	We should certainly go on a list of &quot;people who tried it on once&quot;.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	685	Otherwise, what's to stop someone serious from just trying and trying and trying again?
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	685	We don't want security personnel to focus on people without luggage, or without return tickets, because &quot;focus&quot; is limited, they can only focus on one part of the line by turning their attention from the others.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	685	Either have the backstory of every air traveller checked out to some extent (tbd) before issuing a ticket, or leave that whole aspect of things alone.
Red	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	685	False security is worse than none.Of course, instilling a false sense of security does create the very politically advantageous impression of doing something.
DEFCON1	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	686	Tell us again how they only catch the stupid ones.The problem with this &quot;Behavioural Profiling&quot; is that it can only hope to catch the stupid ones.
teamosil	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	687	Yeah it's true.
teamosil	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	687	In fact, it's kind of a puzzle to me. 9/11 is the only real terrorist attack we've had from outside the US population and that was almost 10 years ago now.
teamosil	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	687	I've been waiting for the other shoe to drop for so long that I'm thinking it isn't going to drop.
teamosil	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	687	Honestly, I don't think terrorism would be very hard...
teamosil	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	687	Break into a construction site, fill a van up with dynamite, park it in a parking garage under a skyscraper...
teamosil	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	687	Seems like if somebody put their mind to it they could pull off a serious attack in a couple of weeks with virtually no funding or connections.
teamosil	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	687	Somebody with training, connections and funding, it should be child's play.
teamosil	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	687	Something doesn't add up.
teamosil	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	687	If Al Qaeda really is a highly organized, well funded, group of tens of thousands of people, and if their goal in life is to kill as many Americans as possible, we should be seeing radically more terrorist attacks in the US than we are.
teamosil	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	687	By now they should have set off a nuke even.
teamosil	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	687	But it isn't happening.
teamosil	Red	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	687	So, my suspicion is that Al Qaeda is either not nearly as big as we think or not nearly as driven to attack civilians in the US as we think.
Red	DEFCON1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	688	You've missed the point.
Red	DEFCON1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	688	It was certainly stupid of me to lose two knives, if that's your point (yeah, dumb old me, how did that news get out?)
Red	DEFCON1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	688	but it would be far from stupid for a real terrorist to mimic me. They only have to carry the knife (or bottle, or whatever) past security once.But that isn't what DW meant by &quot;behaviour&quot;, anyway.
Red	DEFCON1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	688	He was talking about people who are of evil intent, and who cannot present a plausible account of themselves i.e. cannot show what reason they have for travelling, where they intend to go and for what purpose, &amp; so forth.
Red	DEFCON1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	688	That's never been me. What I'm saying is that my stupid slip should have been treated at least as seriously as the stupid slip of our young Strine friend with the coke.
Red	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	689	I couldn't agree more.And we mustn't forget that the American soldiers whose presence in Saudi Arabia so aggravated that bloke Osama Bin Laden have long since been withdrawn, as he very explicitly demanded.
Red	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	689	You met his demands, he stopped (allegedly) sending his cadres to attack your cities.
Red	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	689	Why wouldn't he stop when he got his way - doesn't he want future demands to be received seriously?
Red	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	689	He knew, after all, that he was dealing with a global hyperpower whose motto was:Fool me once, shame on  shame on you.
Red	teamosil	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	689	Fool me  you can't get fooled again.
Red	dk_tv	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	692	It's a fair point.But, even if you're allowed on to a rural plane unchecked, can you really take it over?
Red	dk_tv	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	692	I'm willing to be corrected but I'll bet that, even if they let you walk right onto the plane, they still keep the cockpit door closed - you cannot wander up and chat to the driver, like on a bus.
Red	dk_tv	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	692	So, even if you're carying dynamite and a heavy machine-gun, the best you can hope to do is to (gratuitously) murder all the passengers.
Red	dk_tv	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	692	As Teamosil observed before, if that's all you want to achieve, what's wrong with a train, or a bus, or a shopping-mall as a target?It seems to me that the reason for taking over an aeroplane was always this - international regulations meant that the pilot would always cooperate, he was professionally obliged to do anything it took to ensure the safety of the passengers.
Red	dk_tv	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	692	So you can fly about issuing demands and making statements while the authorities walk on eggshells around you.
Red	dk_tv	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	692	That deal was broken forever on &quot;911&quot;.
Red	dk_tv	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	692	Now, the pilot knows that however slim the chances of his passengers overpowering armed hijackers, if he lets the armed men onto the flightdeck everyone's chance of survival is zero.
Red	dk_tv	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	692	A hijack is now a physical impossibility.
Red	dk_tv	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	692	To take hostages and gain publicity/notoriety like in an old-school hijacking, a siege is now a better bet - like at Beslan.(Incidentally, this change is another reason to doubt the ubiquity of &quot;Al Qaida&quot;.
Red	dk_tv	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	692	Using hijacked planes as missiles was a brilliant stunt, but it exploited a loophole which was immediately closed.
Red	dk_tv	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	692	If there had been a fifth or a sixth team of fanatics available that day, they would also have been in a plane.)So why are we supposed to be at more risk on an aeroplane than in a restaurant?
Red	dk_tv	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	694	Bang on the money!We have the same nonsense in the City of London - someone took all the rubbish bins out of the financial district in case the Provos hide bombs in them.
Red	dk_tv	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	694	Instead, little piles of sandwich wrappers and such-like build up here and there (ideal for concealing bombs, of course).
Red	dk_tv	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	694	But every time someone thinks, &quot;I wasn't raised to do this, but I cannot find a bin and I'm not carrying a chip wrapper for the next hour, so I'll just drop it here&quot;, they are reminded of the constant risk of death and maining by terrorists, and of how hard the council is working to reduce it.Hello, Control?

Divine Wind	FreeWare	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	724	A do-nothing, knee-jerk security procedure erodes our rights without enhancing our security.
Divine Wind	FreeWare	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	724	Example; Does it make sense to deprive a pilot of his nail clippers because of the 1.5 inch nail file on it?
FreeWare	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	725	Which kind of procedures airline companies install or don't install has nothing to do with your rights.
FreeWare	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	725	Claiming a right not to be searched before boarding a plane is equal to claiming a right not to pay for an apple in your local grocery store.
Divine Wind	FreeWare	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	726	The airlines don't set the rules, the government does.
Divine Wind	FreeWare	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	726	Any rules in place should be logical and unbiased regarding race, gender, etc. Searching someone simply because they have a foreign-sounding last name is silly.
Divine Wind	FreeWare	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	726	Behavioral profiling smarter.I don't feel safer because the aircrew was deprived of their nail clippers nor do I feel safer because all the people who admitted they were Muslim were searched while anyone claiming to be Jewish or Christian were given a free pass through security.
FreeWare	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	727	It doesn't matter if UN made the rules, it still doesn't affect your rights.As to the actual question, I'm undecided.
FreeWare	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	727	It can't be denied that the statistics pretty much exclusively turn up Muslims when it comes to terrorism related to air traffic.
FreeWare	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	727	This need not say anything about Muslims in general, nor does it, as you point out, mean that others won't commit the same crime and even given a fee pass to do so while focusing on the usual suspect.
FreeWare	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	727	It's like saying that Christians must be profiled before entering the premises of an abortion clinique.

Divine Wind	FreeWare	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	728	A good analogy.
Divine Wind	FreeWare	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/107801-muslims-airports-should-we-profile.html	728	This is why behavioral profiling is the best way to go along with sound, well thought out security procedures.

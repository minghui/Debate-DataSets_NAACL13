Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	In today's world if a country owes you money you have power over them, you cant honestly say you people did it without the intention of making a profit,Of course we made a profit from it, but that doesn't negate the fact that it helped your country when it desperately needed it.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	So don't go claiming we didn't help you, when we obviously did.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	also you only sold us food because your farmers produced too much, same goes for all your other mass-produced goods.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	And guess what?
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	There are about 250 to 350 other counties we could have sold it to.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	Iraq, the war we(Britain) are fighting now.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	I don't know if you've been watching the news (or maybe that is the problem) but we are still in Iraq.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	We never left.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	We have about 48,000 American troops in Iraq at this moment.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	Guess how many British troops are in Iraq?
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	Go ahead guess!
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	There are as of spring 2010, 150 british troops in Iraq.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	Let me repeat that: 150 british troops in Iraq.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	That's 150 British troops, to our 48,000 troops.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	Your statement was utterly absurd to the greatest degree.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	I'm sorry, who is fighting the Iraq war again?

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	you sold us food thats not really helping.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	"Rationing was introduced into Britain at the tale end of World War One - in February 1918.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Rationing was introduced in response to an effective U-boat campaign and during World War One, the Defence of the Realm Act (DORA) was used to ensure that food shortages never occurred.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	One of the primary aims of DORA, when it was first introduced, was to prevent food shortages.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	At the start of the war, food shortages were self-imposed as the German U-boat campaign had yet to start.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	However, at the start of the war people went around panic buying food and hoarding it at home.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Some shops sold out of food in days in August 1914.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	However, after the initial panic buying, people settled down into a routine and food was not a problem until the end of 1916.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Britain continued to import food during the war.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The main exporters to Britain were America and Canada.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	This meant that merchant ships had to cross the Atlantic Ocean.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Up to 1916, these merchant ships could travel in relative safety.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	However, in 1917, the Germans introduced unrestricted submarine warfare and merchant ships were sunk with great frequency.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	This had a drastic impact on Britain's food supply and with great losses in the Atlantic, food had to be rationed so that no-one starved in Britain.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	In April 1916, Britain only had six weeks of wheat left and bread was a staple part of most diets.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	1916 was a bleak year for families - with the news from the Battle of the Somme and with food in short supply, suddenly the war was brought home to most families.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Food prices rose and by October 1916, coal was in such short supply that it was rationed by the number of rooms a family had in its house.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The restrictions introduced by DORA failed and the government then tried to introduce a voluntary code of rationing whereby people limited themselves to what they should eat.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The standard was set by the Royal Family.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	However, this did not work.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Those who worked in the munitions factories did not have enough food while anyone with money could get more than enough food on the black market.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Any area that could grow food was converted to do so - gardens were turned into allotments and chickens etc.  were kept in back gardens.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The powers introduced by DORA empowered the government to take over land when it felt that it was necessary to do so.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	In 1917, the government took over 2.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	5 million acres of land for farming.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	By the end of the war, Britain had an extra three million acres of farming land.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Those who would have usually worked the land - young men - had been called up, so the work was done by the Women's Land Army.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Conscientious objectors also worked on the land.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The stock market crash of 1929 is usually credited as the cause of the Great Depression but the Dust Bowl certainly didn't help.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	34	You made the claim that the food didn't help at all, and yet you feel the need to ignore the fact that extensive rationing and food shortages occurred in your country.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	34	Did you not say that you admit when you are not wrong?
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	34	Clearly the massive amounts of food imported into your country was much needed, or you navy wouldn't have had a need to defend our trade ships nor would Germany have felt the need to cut off your food supply.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	34	You are being very disingenuous here.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	34	You didn't even know there was a huge drought in the western United States during this time, nor would I expect you to, your educational system probably doesn't even teach about the Dust Bowl expect perhaps on a university level.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	34	You didn't even know about the exploitation of India, you thought that your country improved the conditions in India, when in truth your country we siphoning wealth from India and using their population as an expansion of your military force.

Sazzz	EnigmaticMan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	55	I agree with all your points, but please stop tagging your arguments as USA.
sirius	EnigmaticMan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	56	The EU has the highest GDP in the world.
sirius	EnigmaticMan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	56	The countries of North America have a higher combined GDP than that of England, but does it really make sense to compare a group of economies to a single economy?
sirius	EnigmaticMan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	56	Of course, there are more connections between the EU member countries than that of the members of the NAFTA but the fact remains: you are combining a group of countries to gain the ability to surpass one.
sirius	EnigmaticMan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	56	The only significance that I can see in comparing the economy of the EU to the economy of the US is that it takes most of the EU member countries to equal the single American economy.

sirius	EnigmaticMan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	58	A question that I have to ask is: what is the common trait between an international trading bloc with a population of 500 million and a country divided into states that has a population of 300 million.
sirius	EnigmaticMan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	58	If the European Union "equates to the U.

sirius	EnigmaticMan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	60	A higher total population means more human capital for labor.
sirius	EnigmaticMan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	60	The more human capital generates money and, along with the higher population, creates consumers who increase the GDP.

Sazzz	DaWolfman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	66	As for grammatical errors, whilst being undesirable, they do not render an argument invalid.

DaWolfman	Sazzz	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	67	One who jokes all the time is within himself a fool, defending a fool for no other reason than to point out that the person is a fool seems a tad bit worthless.

This debate is on whether or not England is better than the United States and vice-versa, you are pulling away from the debate at hand to defend a fool on whether or not I was harsh on my response to his post.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	You leave us to fend for ourselves against the majority of Europe, which Nazi-Germany and his allies conquered, but when it comes to a country smaller than yours you need our help.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	And if you recall, we did help you.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	Where this delusion that we "didn't help you" comes from, I cannot say, but you incessantly repeating it makes it no less false.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	Which makes you a hypocrite.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	The might of a country does not come from the size of it's borders.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	I answered your question with another question.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	No you didn't.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	I asked you what made you think that The Japanese were planning to surrender and your response was "what makes you think it's okay to bomb innocent people", which in no way answers my question.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	There was an attempted coup after Emperor accepted surrender, his decision was pretty unpopular even after TWO nuclear weapons leveled two Japanese cities.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	I SIDE-TRACK DEBATE!
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	thats rich (sarcasm by the way), whenever you make a point which i can't argue against I admit I was wrong whereas you just blankout all the evidence which you know is true and pick at the 1 little sentance which you can find fault with.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	I appreciate the fact that you admit when you know you're wrong, but when exactly have I "Blankout all the evidence"?
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	I was wrong then but you have to go back over 600 years to find a war that we lost at a time when England wasn't at the level of unity that it is at now.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	You must have strong resolution to have been wrong so many times in this debate and to continue on.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	No, you will find that this was not your most recent military failure.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	You're forgetting the second and third Anglo-dutch wars and of course the American Revolutionary war.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	I think that its a cunning strategic plan, have you seen how fast China's economy explodes when you leave it on its own.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	I will discuss "morals" at the endYes, but you did not mention how immoral it is to intentionally addict a populace of a foreign country to opium which you are importing into the country illegally.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	World Trade Centre- lack of safety precautionsI won't dispute that, but it doesn't change the fact that your nation has plenty of it's own failures to boast.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	as does nearly every nation on earth.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	It's called Democracy, first you complain that drug smugglings "moral failure" but when we liberate countries thats sill a fail?
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	make up your mindThey wouldn't need to be liberated in the first place, if not for the oppression suffered under English rule.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	The sentance I said was clearly about abortion and did not have the word "condoms" in it.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	As to why I said "It had little to do with condoms".
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	What does abortion have to do with condoms?
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	If anything condoms reduce the cause of abortions, unwanted pregnancies.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	Consequences for everythingConsequences for unprotected sex, and yet you are opposed to means which can reduce disease, unwanted pregnancies and therefore abortions.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	Your position is one of irrationality.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	I don't give a damn about what you can do, this is about your country and mine.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	Okay, but it does no good to complain about what is an effect of the free market.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	Do you propose a solution?
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	Pornography isn't ok because it goes against nearly all religions andis against nearly all traditional morals.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	For you to create a form of world communication"internet" and then use it for pornography is just insulting.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	{Laughs}Maybe you forgot who I am.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	It makes no difference whatsoever what "religious" traditions or morals say, when religion is the manifestation of man's irrationality.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	Religious tradition also taught man that the sun revolves around the earth and anybody who dared say otherwise was a heretic.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	likewise any moral tradition not based on fact and reason, is worthless.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	83	There are many men who have never felt, or never will feel a woman's touch, for them depictions of sex (on print or screen) is as close as they will ever get and this brings them solace.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	85	Because your contention was with, condoms, and then you started talking about abortion, as if the two were related.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	87	We would have to take into account which Nation has more failures and how severe the failures were, we'd also have to take into account the fact that your nation is much older, then come to a conclusion based on our subjective perception of how severe each failure is.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	87	In fact there is some evidence to suggest that pornography can actually reduce the number of rapes, by acting as a release of pent up sexual frustration.

Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	88	Sound fair?
Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	88	"Fair.

Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	88	Japan is a very crowded country, a nuclear attack on any military installation would have resulted in massive civilian casualties, it is unavoidable.

Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	88	"Appearance or not, your argument was not even worth addressing.
Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	88	You could come up with a list American Failures and I would come up with a list of British Failures, then you would come up with some more, then I would come up with some more.
Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	88	which would boil down to a pissing contest which really doesn't prove anything.

Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	88	We would have to take into account which Nation has more failures and how severe the failures were, we'd also have to take into account the fact that your nation is much older, then come to a conclusion based on our subjective perception of how severe each failure is. So you can see why this argument could not possibly amount to anything.
Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	88	"You could say the whole debate is about the rights and wrongs of each country,"You mean "smash statements" based on terms that you invented AFTER THE FACT?
Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	88	No sorry, it doesn't work that way.
Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	88	You cannot say, "well I said this, but I meant this, therefore your arguments are wrong".

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	89	The United States maintained a non-interventionist policy for most of the 18th and 19th century, something I wish we would return to.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	89	Part of the reason we were so reluctant in joining WWI.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	89	One of the main reasons that Britain failed to keep hold of America was because the size of their army just couldn't cover the whole of the U. SSorry, you're trying to equate the size of a nation with it's population.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	89	This is simply false.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	89	The population of Japan is nearly 4 times larger than the population of Canada.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	89	When you came up with a list of my country's "failures" I dealt with them.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	89	Are you certain about that?
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	89	Or did you just then defer to American failures?
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	89	I did say sorry, but once again you completly ignore all mty evidenceEvidence of what exactly?
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	89	That we had allies in almost all of our wars?
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	89	I never said we didn't, so your evidence was completely irrelevant.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	89	If you actually go back and look at the posts, you had originally said that the American Revolutionary war was one of few wars we won, then when I listed numerous other wars that we won you then claimed we didn't win the revolutionary war on our own.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	89	So you either contradicted yourself or you are subtlety changing your arguments mid-debate.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	89	You did the same thing in the when we were talking about the world wars which you claimed we didn't help you, I provide examples of the food, weapons, and supplies we gave you even before we entered the war (both times), you tried (unsuccessfully) arguing that these supplies didn't help at all, then you went on to say we didn't help you.

darthtimon	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	97	As an Englishman who has been to the USA three times, I have nothing against America; indeed, I found the people to be quite friendly- but there are certainly some aspects of American attitudes that annoy me- the 'USA won World War II' thing, for example, is insulting not only to the soldiers of Britain who died, but to the Allied soldiers from Russia, Australia, Canada, various parts of Africa, and to the resistance movements in occupied territory.
darthtimon	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	97	Another major problem I have with the American mindset is the push to teach Creationism as a valid scientific theory in schools- the US has massive influence globally, and some states are encouraging a thoroughly unscientific mindset amongst their youth- the kids who will grow up to be doctors, and scientists, and teachers, and politicians.
darthtimon	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	97	Whilst there is a worrying growth of Creationism in English schools, it is largely confined to private schools.
darthtimon	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	97	I would also dare say I would much rather live in a country where I do not pay through the nose for my healthcare.

Bohemian	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	100	So in reality, each answer is only a single piece to the larger picture.

DaWolfman	jeremyfergus	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	160	So what you are trying to say is that the British stole their own language from the British?

DaWolfman	jeremyfergus	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	166	but it is not broken away if it uses our language.
DaWolfman	jeremyfergus	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	166	So let me get this straight: you are saying that America isn't its own country due to it having a similar ( not identical ) dialect as England?
DaWolfman	jeremyfergus	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	166	So Australia probably isn't its own entity either, due to them using a dialect based off of English.
DaWolfman	jeremyfergus	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	166	Yeah going by your logic that makes perfect sense.

Bohemian	jeremyfergus	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	173	I stated that you were ignorant of how languages are born.
Bohemian	jeremyfergus	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	173	New languages generally begin as a dialect, there simply hasn't been enough time or enough cultural isolation for a new language to emerge.
Bohemian	jeremyfergus	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	173	To suggest this is due to laziness, is a blatantly ignorant assertion.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	175	What constitutes the "worst" parts of a language is entirely subjective.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	175	And no one is forcing anything on you, you are simply being exposed to a different culture, poor you.
DaWolfman	jeremyfergus	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	176	no i am mearly stating that by keeping our language you are either lazy or british wannabe'sSo you are saying that after we kicked your ass in the Revolutionary War we should have spoke an entirely different dialect.
DaWolfman	jeremyfergus	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	176	This isn't in the form of a question, this is what you are saying.

DaWolfman	jeremyfergus	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	178	And my own personal point has been proven: that you truly are unable to discuss anything in a serious or coherent manner.
jeremyfergus	DaWolfman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	179	i think you will find that i am able to discuss a subject in a reasonable matter on a genuine issuebut on this subject you have made arguements just as immiture as i have and while i have tried to continue the topic in an upbeat way by including jokes and trying to laugh aboutit, you have been nothing but stubborn and down right rude.
jeremyfergus	DaWolfman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	179	and that is the real reason america cannever truely compete with the UK because while we brits are polite and enjoy a joke, americans have the social skills of a monkey.

EnigmaticMan	TheDude	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	201	What constitutes proof in your estimation?

EnigmaticMan	TheDude	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	201	Besides, England is a land of refuse where old drunk, fat men rape their women and beat their children out of their homes, which they eventually lose to the Government and somehow maintain the shitty quality of life they had before.
EnigmaticMan	TheDude	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	201	Sorry, moment of weakness.

TheDude	EnigmaticMan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	202	That is all there really is to say.
TheDude	EnigmaticMan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	202	Unless of course you are trying pointlessly to rack up some quick points for your account.

DaWolfman	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	237	According the the US Census Bureau in 1776 the population of the US was put at 2.

DaWolfman	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	237	4 million; it only went up from there.
DaWolfman	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	237	So your argument is that a country that had 100 times more land to cover beat another invading country whose population was over double the country with 100 times the land?

DaWolfman	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	237	Was the bombing a necessity?
DaWolfman	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	237	It could go both ways but I'm not going to delve into it any further as it would be pointless and end up in a totally different debate which has been addressed on this site many times before.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	264	The bow and arrow was more accurate than your early firearms.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	264	The main advantage of a gun is that it could pierce heavy armor, which Native Americans didn't really have any to begin with.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	266	Yes, let's ignore the fact that you thought all native Americans were wiped out, or that they didn't posses firearms.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	266	The Native Americans (or indians as they are known) have been, for the most part, assimilated into American society.

Liddy	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	279	This is a stupid debate.
Liddy	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	279	But since I am American, I'll have to go with my own country.
Hellno2012	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	280	Well by no means am I hating on England, I've been there and it's nice but the weather sucks.
Axmeister	Hellno2012	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	281	At least we dont have tornados, earthquakes and other natural disasters, the worst we have here is rain, which you americans can't cope with.
Micmacmoc	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	282	Hellno, I am quite surprised that you complain we have bad weather when Axeminster lists all of those.
magicalChez	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	283	who won the war?
magicalChez	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	283	with a smaller army and no navy i might add!
Axmeister	magicalChez	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	284	You were against a country smaller than 1/50th your size and we had to come and get you.
Axmeister	magicalChez	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	284	Also who conquered the world?

Whiteshoes44	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	286	If it wasn't for us, England would have been taken over by the Nazis in World War II.
Whiteshoes44	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	286	Be thankful, or we might just flash the big middle finger to you fuckers and take you over ourselves, which we most definitely could do.
Whiteshoes44	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	286	Don't bite the hand that feeds motherfucker, or that hand will pull down their pants and dick slap you bitches :)
Axmeister	Whiteshoes44	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	287	"If it wasn't for us, England would have been taken over by the Nazis in World War II"What are you ballshitting about?
Axmeister	Whiteshoes44	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	287	When we needed your help in WW2 you didn't give it and then you joined when we started winning!
Axmeister	Whiteshoes44	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	287	you have hardly helped us at all compared to the amount of times we followed you into war.
Axmeister	Whiteshoes44	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	287	" or we might just flash the big middle finger to you fuckers and take you over ourselves,"This makes me laugh so much, you couldn't even get to the other side of Vietnam and you think you can cross the Atlantic to get us XD.
Axmeister	Whiteshoes44	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	287	"Don't bite the hand that feeds motherfucker, or that hand will pull down their pants and dick slap you bitches :)"You haven't fed us anything apart from the Bigmac and we could do a lot better without that, we on the other hand have given you nearly everything that makes your country civilizd: Language, Religion, Names, etc.
Hellno2012	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	288	Well I'm American so this is really my only option.
Hellno2012	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	288	I've been to the UK and I liked it a lot but I must say I've seen a lot of Brits put their own country down, that always surprises me.

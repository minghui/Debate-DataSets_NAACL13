jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	1	There is only one question when it comes to abortion, what is it?
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	1	If it is a human being then it requires a very high level of justification to take it's life.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	1	I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	1	The only arguments I have seen are those that try to take away the embryo's humanity and make it less than human.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	1	Roe vs Wade was a very poor decision by the Supreme Court because it introduce a major contradiction in the law.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	1	The unjustified taking of a human life is considered murder under current law and we have different degrees to further define it.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	1	Consider the fact that if you kill a woman with child; you will be charged for two counts of homicide.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	1	But if a doctor kills only one of those persons; no charge.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	1	The Supreme Court by their ruling overturned the law they were supposed to uphold.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	1	The right thing to do would be to overturn this erroneous ruling and restore our rule of law.
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	"I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being.
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	"So a thirteen year old girl gets raped, and you're saying that the govenrment have the right to force that girl to keep her unwanted baby?
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	I would imagine the girl would never really bond with her baby, and the child would have to grow up knowing of its conception and live with the knowledge that it was not wanted.
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	Surely that is justification enough?
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	That is not a life anyone would want, and surely aborting that baby in its early stages of development would be the better thing to do.
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	Also, think of the number of children that would end up in care if abortion was banned.
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	There are enough of them already, the banning of abortion would most definately increase this number, and the more children in care, the lower the quality would become.
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	Where would they get the money to look after so many children?
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	Our taxes?
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	It would get rediculous, and there would be a lot of children out there wishing they had never been born.
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	I do realise that there are problems with abortion, for example, the amount of people who have unsafe sex because they know they can either take the morning after pill or have an abortion is rediculous.
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	But, I'd like to know that if the contraception i was using didn't work and I fell pregnant through no fault of my own, I would be very happy that I have the option to have an abortion.
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	Also, when do you begin to class a fetus as a human?
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	I personally would not think of it as a human untill about 12 weeks.
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	It doesnt even enter the fetal stage untill the 11th week, surely abortion before this stage is not inhumane?
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	If there was a contraception out there that was 100% effective, then this would be a more valid arguement.
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	I'm young, and have dreams and aspirations that I could never fulfill if I became pregnant.
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	If contraception can't garrentee that i won't get pregnant, I definately want the choice to have an abortion if i needed one.
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	You're view seems to be very black and white, and you seem to dismiss the huge grey area that exists.
JessicaNymph	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	2	Abortion exists for a reason and should not be banned
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	To your first point:What you are arguing for is the view known in German as; Lebensunwertes Leben or The Life Unworthy of Life.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	This was the philosophy that drove the Holocaust of Nazi Germany and the one currently underway here in America.

jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	org/wiki/Life_unworthy_of_lifeWhy do I say this?
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	Because you take a class of humans and then give reasons ( very poor ones) of why they should not be allowed to live.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	In Nazi Germany they said; This human should not live because of X.  And you say that this human should not live because of X.  There is a direct correlation here and I hope you see it.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	When you get a chance also pick up the bookFrom Darwin to Hitlerby Dr.  Richard WeikartNow to your question of when do you begin to class a fetus as a human?
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	At the moment of conception.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	Because at that point you now have a complete and distinct human DNA in the cell.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	There is no way around this; humans produce humans and dogs produce dogs.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	About a contraception that is 100% effective every time.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	It's known as abstinence.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	Practice it faithfully and you will never get pregnant or an STD.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	Fail to practice it and pay the price with your life and possibly that of your child's.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	And if you do have an unwanted pregnancy, Please consider adoption.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	Did you know that 1 out of every 6 couples are infertile.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	Do the math, that's a lot of couples who want to have children and can't.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	And I'm one of them.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	It cost me 14,000 dollars to have my daughter and it tears me up inside to know that some parents just discard their children like trash.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	There are thousands of us out here who are screaming; please don't kill it, we'll take it.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	You'd also be surprised to know the high number of Americans who adopt from over seas; and why do they?
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	There aren't enough children to be adopted here because of abortion.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	You noted well that I see this issue as black and white.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	It's called moral clarity.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	When looking at evil I call it as it is; evil.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	Final thought: Were you ever a fetus?
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	Because if you were, Then you have to acknowledge that if your mother would have had an abortion it would have ended your life, not something else, but your life.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	Think about that and look at it real hard because that's what abortion does; it ends the life of a human being in the early stages of development.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	And if you were born after 1972, I challenge you to consider yourself a Survivor of the Abortion Holocaust.
jstantall	JessicaNymph	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	3	1/3 of your generation has been killed by abortion in America!

NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	4	It's not "life unworthy of life", it's actually "POTENTIAL life!
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	4	"Until the fetus can actually survive outside of the womb, it's a living organ like any other organ inside the woman's body.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	4	Once it reaches the stage of about 20 weeks when it should stand a slight chance of survival and maturing into a person, then it should be made illegal.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	4	But before that time, it only has the POTENTIAL, nothing more.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	4	A potential is just that.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	5	it's a living organ like any other organ inside the woman's body.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	5	Then why does it have it's own unique DNA?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	5	And what's the point of the fetal sack?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	5	Why all the complex systems to isolate the fetus from the mothers body?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	5	No serious doctor holds this position; the data doesn't remotely support it.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	5	Once it reaches the stageI did have it right when I said your view decides when a life is worthy of life and when a life is unworthy of life.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	5	You just said it right there.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	5	And here is a list of all the words you use in making this distinction; Until, Once, then, before.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	5	And about this notion of "potential life!
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	5	" by all the standard definitions of life, it's alive and has been throughout, potentiality is a farce.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	5	And finally were do you get this arbitrary standard of survival and person hood?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	5	You see I don't discriminate; If it's human, and it is, then it deserves our full protection.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	5	The most dangerous place in America shouldn't be the womb.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	6	Having its own DNA and all the systems that isolate it from the mother's body does not change the fact that it's completely a part of the mother.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	6	It will not amount to anything if it's detached from her.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	6	I did have it right when I said your view decides when a life is worthy of life and when a life is unworthy of life.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	6	You can think what you like, but at 20 weeks' gestation a fetus is still a person.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	6	The fact that society may be able to save it without its mother does not automatically make it a person.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	6	It's still so very far from actually entering personhood.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	6	And about this notion of "potential life!

NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	6	And finally were do you get this arbitrary standard of survival and person hoodIt's not arbitrary, it's fact.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	6	Me and a lot of other people hold this view.

NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	6	At the moment, we don't actually need to ban abortion cos doing that doesn't actually help, and your argument that abortion equals murder is complete crap.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	It will not amount to anything if it's detached from her.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	That's called discrimination based on level of dependency.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	It would seem to be the more compassionate thing to protect humans who are more dependent on others for their existence.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	You protect the weak, not exploit or kill them.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	It's still so very far from actually entering personhood.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	I'm talking about human life, not personhood.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	Equivocating on terms is an attempt to ignore the obvious; were talking about human life.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	I don't know where you get your definitionOh I don't know, I just went to dictionary.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	com and got this definition and it doesn't discriminate on the basis of level of dependency like you do.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	What you call "potential" it calls life.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	In fact it makes no such distinction.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	Something is either alive or not.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	Also, I couldn't find a definition for potential life, only an article referring to it as a "a clever rhetorical trick" And since the parents of this life are human It's safe to say it's human.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	That ought to be obvious to any casual observer.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	Here is the standard definition of life;the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms, being manifested by growth through metabolism, reproduction, and the power of adaptation to environment through changes originating internally.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	we don't actually need to ban abortion cos doing that doesn't actually helpBanning abortion wouldn't stop the killing of over 1500 humans a day?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	I hope your kidding because of course it would.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	That's why we ban things, to stop them.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	And yes, that would most certainly help all those innocent humans.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	your argument that abortion equals murder is complete crap.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	Well, let's see.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	Something that was, by the standard definition of life, alive is now not alive, by the standard definition of life.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	So if something was alive we refer to it as dead.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	And that death came by willful intent, not an accident.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	In a court of law that's referred to as premeditated homicide.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	But since you can discriminate on the basis of level of dependency or level of development I guess that makes it OK, right ?  I don't think so.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	7	Call it what you will but a duck by any other name is still a duck.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	8	That's called discrimination based on level of dependencyNo, it's called discrimination based on level of development.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	8	Before it reaches a certain stage in development, it'd still only be a potential and it shouldn't have any rights whatsoever.

NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	8	I'm trying to clarify things for, apparently, a stubborn fool.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	8	A human potential life before a certain stage in its development shouldn't be afforded any rights whatsoever.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	8	What you call "potential" it calls life.

NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	8	You're still dishing out BS and completely ignoring my points.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	8	Look up "potential" separately, then marry the 2 definitions together and then you should read this: I agree that it's life, I'm only making a distinction that it's potential.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	8	This is the case because even though it may have all the internal systems of a human life, they're in no condition to function until a certain stage is reached in its development.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	8	That's why it's a potential life.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	8	If you're incapable of putting the meanings of 2 separate words together, we should stop any further discussions.

NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	13	I actually think it's better for Americans to adopt those unfortunate children from the third world.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	13	It will give them a better chance at life in a better society.
handsdown	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	14	Brilliant.
handsdown	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	14	That's it.
handsdown	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	14	Abortion is WRONG, and I don't know why some people can't get it through their thick skulls.
handsdown	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	14	Hmmm if you were a baby and were going to be born and you were aborted, you probably would care.
NVYN	handsdown	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	15	"if you were a baby, were going to be born and were aborted, you probably would care" this statement is all about "if".
NVYN	handsdown	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	15	In reality, the fetus has no mental capacity to care about anything.
NVYN	handsdown	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	15	Before it could survive outside of the mother's womb, it should be entirely the mother's choice, not society's.
NVYN	handsdown	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	15	I believe this is about 20 weeks into the pregnancy.
DaWolfman	handsdown	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	16	Hmmm if you were a baby and were going to be born and you were aborted, you probably would care.
DaWolfman	handsdown	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	16	We wouldn't care.
DaWolfman	handsdown	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	16	We couldn't.
DaWolfman	handsdown	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	16	As a fetus the natural drive humans have for survival really isn't there.
DaWolfman	handsdown	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	16	The mental capacity just wouldn't exist to care.
Houston	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	17	Technically speaking, a fetus is not a human yet.
Houston	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	17	Having an abortion is similar to wearing a condom.
Houston	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	17	No baby is made, yet intercourse still happens.
jstantall	Houston	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	18	A fetus is a stage of development.
jstantall	Houston	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	18	The genes are what determines what kind of fetus it is.  So when a human being has an abortion she takes the life of a human fetus, not the fetus of a dog or cat, a human fetus.
jstantall	Houston	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	18	About the condom.
jstantall	Houston	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	18	Using a condom is what you do before fertilization to try and prevent fertilization.
jstantall	Houston	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	18	An abortion is what you do after fertilization has occurred to stop further growth of the product of fertilization.
jstantall	Houston	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	18	And when done on humans it ends the life of a human in the early stages of development.
jstantall	Houston	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	18	Them are the facts; abortions on humans ends the life of a human, using condoms prevents the fertilization of the human sperm and egg.
Houston	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	19	If wearing a condom only prevents the fertilization of an egg, doesn't it also stop the fetus from being made?
Houston	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	19	There isn't much difference in ending it and not letting it start.
jstantall	Houston	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	20	No, you are simply mistaken.
jstantall	Houston	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	20	A fetus is a stage of development in the life span of an animal.
jstantall	Houston	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	20	We happen to be talking about the life of a human and nothing else.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	21	There is only one question when it comes to abortion, what is it?
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	21	There are more questions than that.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	21	sorryIf it is a human being then it requires a very high level of justification to take it's life.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	21	So you admit that there aresomecases where it is justifiable.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	21	The next question then is who gets to decide?
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	21	Should it be society at large via established government institutions or should it be a private matter left to the sovereignty of the family unit and those health care professionals they consult?
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	22	Let me clarify my position, since I misstated it.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	22	The first question that needs to be asked is " what kind of life is it?
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	22	" If it is a human life then no reason for abortion is adequate.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	22	Therefore no further questions are needed.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	22	I find it rather disturbing that we want to have sex without commitments so badly that we are willing to kill the result of that sexual union.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	22	But isn't that just like human nature, everything is just fine until something conflicts with what we want and stands between us and what we desire.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	22	Then laws get broke, peace treaties ignored, property taken and people killed.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	22	But the most heinous crime is when we make laws to exonerate ourselves.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	22	When we call evil, good.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	22	We may be guiltless before the law but that doesn't mean we are not without real quilt.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	22	But praise be to God that He has provided a solution to the two greatest problems man faces, guilt and death.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	22	With God there is forgiveness, but not without great cost.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	23	Since I disagree with you so often I will snip out some portions of what you typed that I do agree with:I find it rather disturbing that we want to have sex without commitments so badly that we are willing to kill the result of that sexual unionthe most heinous crime is when we make laws to exonerate ourselves.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	23	When we call evil, good.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	23	See I don't disagree with you completely.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	24	God made us the way we are then leave us to deal with it.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	24	Don't bring God into this.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	24	This is our decision.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	25	The first question that needs to be asked is " what kind of life is it?
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	25	" If it is a human life then no reason for abortion is adequate.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	25	Therefore no further questions are needed.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	25	That is an example of what is called jumping to conclusions.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	25	You have not established that it abortion is never justified.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	25	Even if it is agreed (which I do agree with you) that it is a human life.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	26	Ok let me clarify,But let me say I'm not sure why you are pushing this point, but my guess is that it has something to do with authority and you want to make a point about that.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	26	So let me modify what I said; the reasons commonly given for abortions are in adequate.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	26	In the case that the mothers life is endangered, it should be the case that the attending physician should make every attempt and exhaust every means possible to save the life of mother and child, Abortion should never be considered as an easy out, quick fix or money saving option, But if it comes down to it, I think every mother would lay down their lives for their children, it's the most humane thing to do and the most loving; to lay down your life on behalf of someone else.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	26	So even in this case I would still maintain that it should not be an option and I think it would be hard to give an adequate reason why the child's life should be taken and not the mothers.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	26	I think this maintains the sanctity of the child's life throughout and at this point the moral dilemma moves from the child into other areas.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	26	And the Husband and Wife should make the call, if circumstances necessitate it.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	27	Ok, the problem with jstantall is his belief system is clouding all of his arguments.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	27	First of all, the fetus is only a potential life and is no comparison to the actual life that is the mother.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	27	Secondly, we don't even need an excuse to get rid of a fetus if we don't want it.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	27	It's not as if the world's population is dwindling, we actually don't need any more unwanted babies coming into this world!
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	27	We've got enough of the babies that are actually wanted and we also have enough of those who aren't wanted and have become a burden on society because of their natural tendencies to commit crimes, so if you want to save actual lives and not potential lives, then make wars illegal, make climbing Mt.  Everest illegal, make motor racing illegal.
Prevaricate	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	28	attn Jstantall:so why did Bush change the law when he had a Republican Congress and receptive Federal judges ? ?
Prevaricate	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	28	you can't blame this on limp Democrats or socialist liberals
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	29	Well, if you have a lame duck congress who stonewalls him on everything; I think it would be reasonable to blame them.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	29	But that's not the question at hand is it?
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	29	The question is; what is being killed in an abortion?
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	29	that's the only one that matters.
Prevaricate	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	30	is Bush # 43 ancient history?
Prevaricate	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	30	during his eight years, he had a Republican controlled Congress that was NOT in a lame duck statuseven when it was so-called lame duck, are yah telling me that the Republicans would have voted against Bush administration abortion restrictions ? they had the 50+% Congressinal majority and could have forced a Senate filibuster debatebut i suspect that the Republican leadership primarily give the anti-abortionist lip service
Prevaricate	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	31	FYI Jstantallin 2004 Bush won re-electionthe Republicans increased their Senate majority from 51 to 55 seatsthe Republicans increased their Congressional majority from 229 to 231the Republican party was not in a lame duck status and could have curbed Roe versus Wadeexcuses, excuses, excuses . . .
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	32	FYIThe question is not who did or didn't do this or that.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	32	The question is should abortion be banned.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	32	I say it already is.  We already have laws against murder; it's just that Roe vs Wade made a loop hole in the law and that ought to scare the hell out of any sane individual.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	32	Because with that ruling a whole class of people just became non persons and no longer protected under the Constitution.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	32	Abortion is the unjustified taking of a human life in the early stages of development and that is wrong.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	32	And if it is within in your power to stop it and you don't; you are just as guilty, regardless of your political affiliation.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	33	The view of "Abortion is the unjustified taking of a human life in the early stages of development and that is wrong" is expected of a pro-lifer looking to force his/her belief on others.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	33	Abortion is actually not unjustified.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	33	People have very good reasons to do it.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	33	It's not a fun activity, so to arrive at the decision people would have had to consider lots of options.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	33	Abortion is also not the taking of a human life.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	33	It's the prevention of a human life, same as having sex with a condom, using the pills, abstinence, etc. . . Finally, believe what you want, but don't force it on others.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	33	I respect pro-lifers' views, they should respect my views.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	33	What I do with my body doesn't affect the quality of their lives.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	33	Don't affect the quality of mine!
wolfbite	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	34	Even if the senate could overturn Roe vs Wade, 55-51 in the Senate is really not much of a majority.
wolfbite	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	34	Hell, if you look at the current Senate they have 60 members and they can't even get anything done.
wolfbite	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	34	The Democrats could have easily filibustered any attempt that would have been as controversial as removing abortion laws.
jstantall	wolfbite	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	35	I agree, go back and look at the record of Congress under Bush; it's record is shameful.
jstantall	wolfbite	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	35	If Bush couldn't get appointees even voted on; How could he possible address such a controversial subject as abortion?
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	36	okay, I just looked at it.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	36	So what exactly did Bush want that he didn't get?
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	36	I see nothing here.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	36	including that bs war in Iraq, the unconstitutional "Patriot" Act, and that 900 billion dollar tax cut that didn't do jack to help the economy.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	36	That's not really the point though.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	36	This is about abortion,go ahead, try and make it illegal.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	36	The world has been through this a dozen times, and for hundreds of years.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	36	Illegal Abortions prevent 0 abortions from happening, and kills woman that have to go to basements and the homes of people who may or may not be doctors to get the procedure, and who often die as a result.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	36	Amen right man . _.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	I would rather lose a handful of women occasionally through botched abortions than sacrifice on average 1500 children daily to save those women.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	If perfection is your standard for law then you are correct, however laws were meant to restrain.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	And prior to Roe vs Wade the law against abortion did that quite well, perfection?
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	No.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	Made it rare?
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	most certainly.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	And what happened after Roe vs Wade?
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	abortions went through the roof.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	Laws are meant to keep us from killing ourselves off but Roe vs Wade does the opposite.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	it sanctions it.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	Consider Europe, within a hundred years, if not sooner, Europeans will cease to exist as a unique people group.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	Why?
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	Zero Population growth.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	They're not reproducing and when they do, they kill it.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	Europe will be a Muslim nation within our lifetime, Why?
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	They're having families.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	37	So please tell me why we should follow the Europeans into extinction?
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	1.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	duh, the point is these woman are going to have an abortion whether it's banned or not.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	So either the cluster of cells is removed and the woman lives.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	Or the cluster of cells is removed and the woman dies.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	Either way, abortion being banned has never in human history stopped people from getting abortions.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	2.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	No, it didn't make it rare, that's the point.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	Banning abortion doesn't stop it, it just hides it and demonizes woman, who many times are only children at the time, and who many times were raped.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	And you wonder why no one likes talking hardcore Christians about this kind of thing.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	3.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	wtf?
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	have you been reading the white supremacist newsletter again?
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	Europe's population is doing just fine.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	And there's nothing wrong in and of itself if they do end up having more muslims than whatever they have now.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	Who cares?
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	Why's it your business what someone else does?
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	And who the fuck is "we" you arrogant ass.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	The US does not have a "we"we're supposed to be founded on the idea of diversity and freedom.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	38	I find this entire post incredibly offensive, and you get a rare downvote from me.
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	39	You said 'who many times were raped'I say ONLY 1% OF ALL ABORTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE BECAUSE THE PREGNANCY IS THE RESULT OF RAPE OR INCEST!
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	39	I have posted this many times.
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	39	What would you say if a court ruling said that a child is not a human being until the age of 15?
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	39	The murder rate of children would INCREASE.
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	39	The abortion numbers INCREASED AFTER Roe v.  Wade.
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	39	The numbers would DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY if abortion was illegal.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	40	Your point on whether a child of 15 years is a human being or not is ridiculous.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	40	We're talking about a fetus that can't survive outside the womb, we're talking about a potential life, not an actual life.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	40	A 15 year-old is a person so your "what if" is simply laughable.
helloim123	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	41	Babies can be seen silently screaming during an abortion.
helloim123	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	41	What does that tell you?
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	42	It tells me you've been watching a certain anti-abortion video too many times :)
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	43	I am pro-life.
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	43	I am a faithful Christian.
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	43	I have five younger siblings.
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	43	The two youngest I remember their life clearly.
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	43	I want you to look at a one day old baby, look at her fingers, toes, face, legs, watch her breathe, and watch her interact with people and tell she was not a human being in the womb.
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	43	I want you to watch a 2 year old play with her baby sister and tell me that the baby was not a human being in the womb.
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	43	I want you to look at a one day old baby, look at her fingers, toes, face, legs, watch her breathe, and watch her interact with people and tell she was not a human being in the womb.
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	43	If you can do either of these, I will be astounded about how emotionless you are.
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	43	And I will pray that some day abortion is illegal.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	44	I happy for you that you have all these great images and memories of young children playing together, etc. . .  very touching, i hope you treasure them for ever.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	44	But you're not talking about fetuses are you?
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	44	We're talking about fetuses, especially the ones before the age of 20 weeks in its development.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	44	Get back on track please!
iamdavidh	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	45	I've seen these videos.
iamdavidh	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	45	If it's not self-aware it's not a human yet, no matter what itlookslike.
iamdavidh	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	45	You're talking aboutyou'refeelings and whatyoubelieve because you're a typical self-righteous self-involved christian completely incapable of understanding that whatyouthink and feel is not what everyone else thinks and feels.
iamdavidh	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	45	The laws put in place on abortion take into account whatsciencefinds to be truenot how youfeelhelliom or what you think some invisible daddy in the sky wants you to feel.
iamdavidh	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	45	Abortion is illegal after the third trimester except in extreme circumstances.
iamdavidh	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	45	Before then it's not a human yet, it's the specific woman's body and not yours, and it's none of your business.
iamdavidh	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	45	That's how it is and that's how it should be,no matter how many of you right wing nuts highjack this site and serial downvote us sane and logical participants on the site.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	46	Its me again!
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	46	If it's not self-aware it's not a human yet, no matter what it looks like"Then why are we so worried about the trees?
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	46	Are they are "self aware"?
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	46	Actually, human children are not self aware for some time AFTER birth.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	46	Does that mean we can dump them if we change our minds?
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	46	Abortion is illegal after the third trimester except in extreme circumstances"Not exactly true.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	46	There are states, and forgive me for not remembering right off the top of my head which ones, that allow abortion "up to the moment of birth"I will see if I can find that one.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	46	no matter how many of you right wing nuts high jack this site and serial down vote us sane and logical participants on the site.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	46	"Now thats disappointing.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	46	I really thought after reading some of you responses that you were more open and intelligent than this.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	46	Isn't it cool to be tolerant anymore?
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	great . _. 1.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	Who's worried about trees?
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	It just doesn't make sense to cut all of them down without planting new ones, since then all humans would die, born or not.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	2.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	Um, kids are self-aware, they just don't developempathyuntil sometime after birth.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	But a new born has feelings, knows when it's hungry, etc.  Therefore it's wrong to throw them in dumpsters.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	3.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	True, and it's state to state.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	But even the states that do allow it up to birth, again it is only in extreme circumstances.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	If I'm a woman inanystate and I'm due in a week, and my life is not in danger, and I'm not a child myself and I wasn't raped by my dad or something, then abortion is not an option.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	And I'm fine with that actually, I think it's the right law.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	4.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	About 2 or 3 months ago I'd say 5 right wing nuts showed up here and downvoted nearly every argument I've ever made in my over a year on this site.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	It's why I don't show up as often.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	If someone wants to disagree fine, but use facts and logic.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	I'm tired of having the Bible quoted at me, responses rife with logical fallacies, responses that didn't bother to read what I wrote, and those who need to announce their faith before making an argument when their faith has 0 to do with the argument.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	47	I never downvote or insult anyone just because I disagree, I do so when they act like a moron, whether I agree with them or not.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	1.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	The argument I was trying to make is that the Left seems to be more concerned about saving trees than they are HUMAN BEINGS.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	Thats another "debate" I guess.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	2.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	OK not an argument here but I would appreciate some clarification.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	is it empathy or self awareness we are waiting for before we call them human?
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	The reason I am asking is because it was my experience with my son that he almost immediately could sense his mothers emotional state and reacted in kind.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	He recognized both my wife's and my voice and music that he heard while in the womb.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	3.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	I somewhat agree on this one in that if the birth risks the life of both the mother and the baby then there is no choice.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	I will admit I would anguish over a decision like that for the rest of my life.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	As far as rape goes.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	while it is certainly not the fault of the mother that it happened to her it is also not the fault of the child.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	4.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	I understand that but remember "when your enemy makes you angry . . .
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	they win" Someone really smart and famous said that but for the life of me I cant recall who.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	Try not to forget that "facts" and "logic" vary according to each individuals viewpoint and at times, can be subjective both on the right and the left.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	They are as tired of you quoting science that they dont believe in as your are of them using a book that you dont believe in.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	Both groups have absolute belief in their sources.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	If they are "right wing nuts" let them be.
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	wont that just about make your argument for you?
dtrimble	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	48	Dad always said that we catch more flies with honey than we do vinegar!
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	1.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	The left is generally anti-war, pro healthcare, pro helping starving people in Africa, etc, all of which saves lives.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	Since I don't consider a fetus a life, from my standpoint the right is more concerned with vague moral standards only shared by the right than saving lives, but whatever.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	2.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	I'm talking about self-awareness, as in feelings.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	A fetus before the third trimester has 0 capacity to feel.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	They're not sad about being aborted, it doesn't hurt them, they don't have these human emotions yet.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	This is what I'm talking about.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	That an already born child likes its mom in no way invalidates this point.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	3.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	And here is the disconnect, you are absolutely correct.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	But the leap so many on the right are not willing to make is that abortion isalwayssomething to anguish over.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	Sure, there are bitches (and I don't use that term lightly) who simply don't care.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	But the vast vast vast majority of abortions are performed by women who feel they simply have no choice.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	It isnota party.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	But it'stheirchoice, somethingtheyhave to live with.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	Not the right wing, not you personally, just her, no one else's business.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	The only thing making abortions illegal would change is the number of mothers who die with the child.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	That's all it changes no matter how pretty this anti-abortion idea that "if we just shove what we really really really feel down everyone's throat everyone will live happily ever after, amen" - that's not how it works.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	Woman have been having abortions one way or another, legal or illegal, since the beginning of time.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	As for your point about rape.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	It's not the fault of the "child" only because the "child" doesn't exist.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	It's a cluster of cells and if she wants to abort it it's her choice, again, not yours.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	4.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	facts and logic never vary.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	People are wrong about facts and logic, but in and of themselves, they are constant.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	It is afactthe earth is round for example.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	Some have the "opinion" it is not, but this is not an opinion, this is simply wrong.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	There is a fact at the bottom of when a fetus becomes self-aware, people who study biology for a decade before becoming a doctor believe this to be around the 3rd trimester.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	Whatever the answer really is, I trust the dude who studied it for a decade over people who think they speak in tongues and give their live savings to Jerry Falwell.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	Is the exact moment as definite as the shape of the earth?
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	No, probably not.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	But it's notthatbig a mystery, and while a valid opinion may vary by a month or so of when this elusive self-awareness begins, it most certainly isnotupon conception, or even 2 or 3 months later.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	It's akin at that point to saying the earth has to be flat because when I stand on my roof I can't see it curve.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	Here's the difference between an argument with two different opinions, and the abortion debate.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	Indulge me, I enjoy coming up with analogies.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	2 people are walking through a forest.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	1 wants to go left, the other right.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	The one who wants to go right says they both have to go right.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	The one who wants to go left says his friend can go right if he likes, but for himself, he thinks he should be able to choose.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	That's the gist of it.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	It's not a matter of two sides fighting about what everyone should do.
iamdavidh	dtrimble	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	49	It's about one side trying to force everyone to do something they may or may not want to and the other saying since we really don't know where either leads, people should have the choice.
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	50	Have you ever seen an ultrasound?
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	50	Have you ever seen a desperate teen change her mind to have an abortion after seeing her ultrasound?
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	50	Have you seen a 3-D ultrasound?
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	50	All these moments are life changing!
iamdavidh	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	51	This is ridiculous.
iamdavidh	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	51	Yes I've seen all of this stuff.
iamdavidh	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	51	I even had a girlfriend who had an abortion.
iamdavidh	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	51	You're being ridiculous, just because you feel something doesn't make it true.
DaWolfman	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	52	Mate . . .
DaWolfman	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	52	stop.
DaWolfman	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	52	These moments may be life changing foryou.
DaWolfman	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	52	None of these things change what a desperate woman is willing to do to get that fetus out of her stomach.
DaWolfman	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	52	And to me having one unaware parasite not get achance at lifeis better than an unaware parasite and an aware human beingbothending up in some form of dumpster.
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	53	What videos?
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	53	I never mentioned videos or movies!
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	53	I was talking about watching my two baby sisters play with each other
iamdavidh	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	54	I assumed another ultrasound video, and I've seen like 50 of them.
iamdavidh	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	54	But this is even worse, no one wants to see your sisters, and that video has 0 to do with abortion since they are already born.
wolfbite	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	55	He tried to fight abortion, the double homicide law was put in place when he was in office.
wolfbite	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	55	The problem with the Roe vs Wade ruling is that in order for it to be overturned the Supreme Court must take action because of checks and balances.
wolfbite	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	55	So people can protest to Congress and the President all they want, but unless the courts take action it won't matter.
jstantall	wolfbite	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	56	You are correct about the double homicide law; however the contradiction is inherent in the ruling itself.
jstantall	wolfbite	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	56	The double homicide law was only raised to illustrate this.
jstantall	wolfbite	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	56	In fact I would argue that the law (double homicide) came to be because of the contradiction.
jstantall	wolfbite	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	56	You might be correct about overturning the ruling.
jstantall	wolfbite	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	56	It might take another case challenging this ruling and it's constitutionality.
jstantall	wolfbite	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	57	You are correct about the double homicide law; however the contradiction is inherent in the ruling itself.

jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	I'd like to take the time to address several tings that have been raised in this debate and clarify my argument against abortion.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	First, the affect this debate has on women who have had abortions.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	This reality has weighed heavily on my conscience.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	But I think a greater issue is at stake here and therefore the cost is worth it.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	The greater good that is being served here is the hope that abortion on demand might someday be ended and that the emotional trauma it causes to women will be ended also.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	The holocaust of abortion will not be ended until people see and know the reality of what it is.  It has been stunning to see through the course of this debate the lengths people will go to so as to sugar coat this issue and make it appear not so bad; and actually justifiable.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	So my effort is to make that know as best I can.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	But the truth is that when women, who have had abortions, come to a correct understanding of what has happened there is real pain and real quilt; and that certainly is not to be dismissed.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	So for those who have had abortions I say there is a way out of the pain and quilt; true forgiveness is possible.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	There is only one way out and that is through the great exchange; God in Christ takes your life and He gives you His.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	When He died, you died and the charges against you are paid in full, the debt is canceled.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	Then the life of perfection He lived becomes yours; it is laid to your account.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	So you go from an infinity negative debt to an infinity positive righteousness.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	And through His resurrection you are raised to newness of life.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	This is only possible through repentance and faith.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	Confess your sins and trust God to do for you what he said He would in Christ.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	This faith is not a leap in the dark, like crossing your fingers.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	It is an active trust, like standing on solid ground; a confident expectation in the faithfulness of God.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	With that said I would like to clarify my argument against abortion further and answer the questionshould abortion be banned.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	But let me preface my argument with a disclaimer.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	I realize there is a difference between proof and persuasion.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	There is no argument that I can put forth that can't be disputed.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	There are actually people who will argue for the reality of square circles.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	So I put this argument forth for those who are truly open-minded; in hopes you will be persuaded.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	The taking of the life of an innocent human being without proper justification is murder and murder is illegal.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	Abortion takes the life of an innocent human being without proper justification.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	58	therefore it is murder and should be illegal
jstantall	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	59	I should further say to disprove this argument you have to falsify it's key premise and that is:abortion takes the life of an innocent human beingThat' why this whole debate hinges on one key question: What is it?
jstantall	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	59	And genetically it is human.
jstantall	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	59	It has it's own unique and complete chromosome which makes it distinct from it's parents and wholly different from the egg and sperm used to create it.
jstantall	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	59	Since this syllogism is sound and it's premises are verifiable you will have to resort to irrationality and unscientific assertions to disprove it.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	60	I will take the bait for fun.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	60	I assume (unless you refute it explicitly) you agree that there aresomecases where abortion is merited or "medically necessary"Who is the proper authority for determining medical necessity?
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	60	expected answer from you (according to the way I think you think):GovernmentAnswer I would give: The doctor and those consulted by the pregnant woman.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	60	Abortion is not banned.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	60	The murder of the unbornisillegal and punishable as murder.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	60	Abortion is not murder if you admit that it iseverdone by medical necessity and without malicious intent.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	60	since this argument is flawless, all who disagree are just plain old sloppy thinkers ~sarcastic snicker
helloim123	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	61	No, I disagree.
helloim123	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	61	There is no right time to have an abortion.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	62	OK agreed you have to establish intent.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	62	However, all abortions are premeditated, what say you?
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	62	Your assumption of my answer would be false, see my other response for the answer.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	62	However to your point,you plain old sloppy thinker you, My qualification was:without proper justificationand in this case it could be argued as proper justification.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	62	However, the point of my syllogism was to highlight the importance of the question:what kind of life is ityour objection highlights the point more becuse there would be no moral dilemma if it was a chicken.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	63	Until at least week 20 of its development, the fetus has not been proven to be able to survive outside of the mother's womb.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	63	Since society can't keep it alive, it's the mother's choice.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	63	Plain and simple.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	63	My point: Until the fetus can survive outside of the mother's womb, it's like any other living organ inside of her and is only a POTENTIAL life, not ACTUAL life.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	63	Potential life is any stage from an independent sperm/egg to week 20 of fetal development.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	During the Holocaust, approximately 11 million people were killed between 1933 till 1945.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	These people include Jews, homosexuals, Slavics (Russians, Poles, and others), Gypsies, mentally and physically disabled, Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Christians found helping the targeted people.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	That was fifty years ago and today Hitler and the Nazis are known as criminals and mass murderers.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	But why are the doctors who perform abortions not called criminals or mass murderers?
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	From 1973 to 2005, over 46 million abortions have been performed.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	This is much higher death rate than from the Holocaust.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	For abortion the approximate death rate is 1.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	4 million babies each year.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	The approximate death rate for the Holocaust, however, is about 917 thousand people a year.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	The Nazis targeted the people they did because they believed they were inferior to themselves.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	Women who have abortions kill their babies because they believe that they are superior to these children.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	To this day, Germans have collective shame because of what the Nazis did, even though they did nothing to help.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	In fifty years will Americans have collective shame because so many abortions were performed?
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	Will Americans be known as mass murderers and criminals?
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	The subject of abortion and the Holocaust are very closely related subjects.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	The Jews were killed because they were unwanted and inconvenient.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	A child is aborted because they are unwanted and inconvenient.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	I want you to tell me the Holocaust was wrong and then tell me abortion is okay.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	You just can't do that.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	One can't be wrong and the other right.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	64	That is like saying rape is wrong but incest is okay.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	65	Abortion before the fetus can actually survive outside of the mother's womb is not the same as killing Jews or mentally or physically sick people.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	65	The fetus before it can survive outside the womb is only a POTENTIAL life, which fall into the same category as an independent egg or sperm and anything else in between.
Houston	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	66	Having an abortion is just as "unethical" as swatting a fly, if not less.
Houston	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	66	The fetus cannot survive on it's own, it is not a human yet.
Houston	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	66	The fly can survive on it's own.
Houston	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	66	Thus, I find it more "unethical" to kill a fly than have an abortion.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	67	Religion can't be your argument, since it hinges on what people believe and some believe in choice.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	67	When you say "women", you generalize and include all females, but some women, again, prefer a choice.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	67	I've said it plenty of times and I'll say it again, a fetus before it can survive outside of the mother's womb is a POTENTIAL life, which is the same as an independent egg or sperm and anything else in between.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	68	Quoting god is not how you're going to win arguments.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	68	I actually respect what you believe, but I ask that you also respect what I believe.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	68	I believe that women should have the choice.

alstars	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	69	But if you had given them a chance to live, then they would have proved worthwhile to live!
alstars	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	69	Just think how many masterminds have been killed before birth?
alstars	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	69	If they had lived, may be they would have made their world a peaceful heaven!
NVYN	alstars	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	70	Many of the aborted fetus may have also grown up to be rapists, serial murders, terrorists, armed robbers.

NVYN	alstars	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	70	then there's nothing more to add.
tasialicious	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	71	Abortion should definetly be banned!
tasialicious	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	71	Their is a lot of things to prevent pregnancies such as condoms, birth control and getting your tubes tied!
tasialicious	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	71	If you know you are not old enough or financially stable to take care of a child then don't have sex, just use protection.

tasialicious	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	71	i don't get how if you kill somebody then you get charged for murder, and spend the rest of your life in prison.
tasialicious	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	71	when on the other hand having an abortion is murdering a baby.
tasialicious	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	71	To me that doesnt make any sense.
tasialicious	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	71	and some people say but what if the person got raped and ended up pregnant.
tasialicious	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	71	well you can give it up for adoption, i feel that women who have abortions are selfish and are only thinking about themselves.
tasialicious	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	71	They really don't care about what the baby goes through and that is completely wrong!
NVYN	tasialicious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	72	The "baby" is not yet a baby.
NVYN	tasialicious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	72	It's only a POTENTIAL life and not an ACTUAL life.
NVYN	tasialicious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	72	So you're not killing a baby.
NVYN	tasialicious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	72	If it can't survive outside of the womb yet, then it's not actually anyone else's choice but the mother's.
NVYN	tasialicious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	72	Noone else can keep it alive, then they should butt out and leave it up to the mothers.
NVYN	tasialicious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	72	If she wants to put it up for adoption, great!
NVYN	tasialicious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	72	, If not, it's her choice since she is the one that has to keep it alive inside her.
danzi94	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	73	100% i think its wrong!
danzi94	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	73	I am not religious, but who has the right to take a life?
danzi94	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	73	Isn't that the very reason Murderer's are punished?
danzi94	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	73	If a person really can't have a child because they aren't ready, or any other reason, then surly it is fairer to still give that life a chance and put the baby up for adoption to a family who is desperate for a baby and can't have one for themselves?
NVYN	danzi94	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	74	If you take a life you should be punished.
NVYN	danzi94	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	74	But before the fetus can survive outside of the mother's womb, it's not yet a life, it's only a POTENTIAL life, like an egg or sperm, that's all.

NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	76	It's time people stop bashing bibles!
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	76	Now the difference between a fetus and a person has been over-explained here but you pro-lifers hold on to your belief that it's the two are the same.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	76	It's fine if you believe that, but don't go around forcing that belief on others.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	76	I'm sure the bible has a passage somewhere about how you should respect your neighbours.

NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	78	Does the Bible say that it's ok to wage war against people of another religion?
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	78	You people are the reason why there are wars.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	78	You just can't help forcing your belief on others and then quotemine the Bible to justify your actions.

nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	85	Unborn babies are living things and when you kill them, it is the same thing as killing an adult or a child.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	85	God is the creator of life and when you kill unborn babies you are destroying his creations.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	85	In the beginning God created Adam by breathing the breath of life into his nostrils.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	85	“For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	85	” Psalm 139:13.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	85	Abortion is when you kill an unborn baby, and the people who do this are selfish because they don't want to spend money on the baby, confused because they don't want to be pregnant, and evil because they kill children, they also don't trust god and what he provides.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	85	If somebody did this they would be breaking the fifth commandment: You shall not murder.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	85	He or she is also breaking the first commandment : You shall have no other gods.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	85	You should help everyone stay healthy and alive.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	85	I have four sisters and I am glad none of us have been aborted.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	86	"it is the same as killing an adult or a child".
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	86	No, it is not.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	86	It is only a POTENTIAL life and not ACTUAL life.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	86	Before week 20, the fetus cannot survive outside of the mother's womb.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	86	It must be attached to her and be supplied with her blood.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	86	If society can't keep it alive, then society should not make laws forcing mothers to keep their unwanted pregnancies.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	86	It is physically attached to her and is a part of her and must be her choice.
ilovelynx36	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	87	Yes it should be banned.
ilovelynx36	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	87	People shouldn't be having sex if they don't wanna a baby.
ilovelynx36	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	87	Or it should be protected.
ilovelynx36	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	87	Killing babies is a crime.
NVYN	ilovelynx36	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	88	People shouldn't be having sex?
NVYN	ilovelynx36	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	88	Doesn't that mean they'll be preventing babies from being born = preventing conception in the first place?
NVYN	ilovelynx36	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	88	What if that baby wanted to be conceived but its parents decided to use a condom and prevented it from being?
NVYN	ilovelynx36	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	88	How far back to the future do you want to take this "life" argument?
NVYN	ilovelynx36	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	88	Here's where I draw the line: Before the fetus can digest milk via its digestive tract, it is entirely the mother's decision whether it should be aborted or not.
NVYN	ilovelynx36	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	88	It is PHYSICALLY a part of her and is not yet capable of survival without direct connection to her (via the umbilical cord) and so it is her decision and should not be made illegal.
Platypus6784	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	89	yes abortion should definetly be banned because if you look at it from court/police type of view then you could definetly call it murder if you abort something beause the actual definition of murder is killing somebody with intent.
Platypus6784	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	89	so abortion should definetly be banned!
NVYN	Platypus6784	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	90	Ok, before you go around saying having an abortion = killing "somebody" consider this:does a pregnant woman need a passport for her belly when she travels?
NVYN	Platypus6784	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	90	Does the fetus inside of her know anything?
NVYN	Platypus6784	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	90	Can it make any decisions?
NVYN	Platypus6784	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	90	What kind of a "person" is it?
NVYN	Platypus6784	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	90	IT'S NOT A PERSON!
NVYN	Platypus6784	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	90	Before it can survive outside of its mother's womb, it is not society's choice but the mother's choice.
NVYN	Platypus6784	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	90	Don't take that choice away from the mother.
August	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	91	Hi, I am a eighteen year old senior who was born two and a half months premature, a time when abortion's have been done.
August	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	91	My mother and I were both in extream danger of dieing, my parents could have said, take it out and get my wife/myself out of danger then I would not be here today and plenty of children will never have a voice.
August	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	91	If a mother or a couple does not want a child there is always the option of putting the child up for adoption, at least it will have a chance at life and a loveing family.
jstantall	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	92	Thank you for your testimony.
jstantall	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	92	I'm so glad you spoke up and would strongly encourage you to do it more often.
jstantall	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	92	Apart from rape your case is the most often used justification for abortion.
jstantall	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	92	And as your existence proves it is not proper justification.
jstantall	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	92	I know of a woman ( I can't remember her name) but her mother was rapped.
jstantall	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	92	I know of her because she is doing public speaking on this issue of abortion.
jstantall	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	92	You are a testimony to the fact the abortion snuffs out a human life because it would have taken yours.
jstantall	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	92	Thank you again.
August	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	93	Sorry for not saying anything until now, but that means a lot to me.  It is about how we see a child before it is born and it seems that so many people do not think of who will be.
NVYN	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	94	The option of putting up a child for adoption should always be made available but not compulsory.
kamranw	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	95	I would just like to add one more thing.
kamranw	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	95	Everyone who is for abortion seems to insist this should solely be the woman's decision.
kamranw	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	95	Why is that?
kamranw	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	95	What about the father?
kamranw	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	95	Why should he have no say in a child that he would have to bear legal responsibility to if it were born?
kamranw	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	95	Suppose, a father says he does not want the child and she has it anyway.
kamranw	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	95	He is still legally liable to this child.
kamranw	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	95	Now, suppose the opposite.
kamranw	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	95	He wants the child, is willing to raise this child without any financial support from the mother and is willing to bear all financial burden of the mother while she is unable to work.
kamranw	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	95	He should not have this right?
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	96	The father's decision or the mother's decision?
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	96	What does it have to do with the fact that it should be banned or not?
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	96	This is a NON-ARGUMENT.
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	97	When the man has sex with a woman, he knows he is potentially creating a life.
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	97	He must be prepared to accept whether the woman wants to keep it.
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	97	It's inside her, not him.
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	97	Consider you taking your child over to a neighbour and asks him to babysit the child while you go out for dinner.
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	97	The neighbour shouldn't have to babysit just because you asked him.
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	97	He has to look after the child, so he has the choice to do it or not.
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	97	You are responsible for this child whether he wants to babysit or not.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	98	OK this is not an argument against abortion but I do think it is a good reason they should be banned.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	98	I'll let the story speak for it's self.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	99	It's a moving story, yes.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	99	However the boy is now a life!
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	99	Before it became a life, it was only a potential life attached to its mother and is completely dependent on her.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	99	Only she should have the say in whether it should be kept or not.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	99	I am pro-choice, so I say give the women who are considering abortion as much counselling and options and information as you can, but before the fetus can survive outside of her womb it's her choice and society should not make her do anything she doesn't want to do.
helloim123	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	100	In 95% of cases it is the woman's fault for becoming pregnant, especially in teen cases.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	101	Are you arguing against abortion or against your intelligence?
helloim123	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	102	I find this insulting.
helloim123	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	102	I think pro-choice people are pro-choice because they are afraid that if women lose the freedom to choose if they have an abortion, we will start to lose other freedoms.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	103	You find it insulting because I'm insulting you.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	103	Your stupendous lack of brains brings me nausea.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	104	Abortion is dumb, all the woman who have any are STUPID!
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	104	Abortion could ruin the race of mankind!
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	104	Then we would all be dead!
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	104	AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	104	I do NOT like the idea of abortion and obama is stupid to give federal funds to abortion!
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	105	Abortion could actually save mankind.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	105	An aborted fetus could well grow up to be another Hitler or worse, then mankind would really be f. . . ed.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	105	So think about that!
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	I wrote this speech.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	read it and it will answer your questions.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	Abortion: Choose Life-it begins at Conception:Think about this.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	A girl had an abortion, thinking that the baby wasn’t living so it wouldn’t matter.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	But, after she had the abortion, she saw what she thought wasn’t living, and it actually was.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	The baby was living and she watched it die.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	From then on, she couldn’t even live with herself knowing that she killed a living human being.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	This story that I just told you is true.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	A lot of women think that it isn’t a baby before they have the abortion, and I will explain to you that abortion is the killing of a living baby.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	Well, if life doesn’t begin at birth, then when does it begin?
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	Life begins at conception.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	This is a fact, because there is a lot of proof that can back that fact up.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	For example, there is scientific proof and there is Biblical proof.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	To further explain what abortion is, I will talk about these important things: one, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, two, how scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception, Three, what we can do about the abortions, and finally, why girls get abortions.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	Those are all the things that should be thought about, so I will be explaining them, to help you understand them.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	Some woman have abortions because of these three things: one, They might think that they’re too young to have a baby, two, their boyfriend or spouse makes them have an abortion, three, if they do have the abortion the girl’s parents would get mad at her.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	The case also might be that she just doesn’t want to deal with the baby.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	First, you probably ought to know what abortion is.  Abortion is killing the baby inside you when you are pregnant.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	Every year 1.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	5 million babies are killed by abortion.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	That’s 125,000 babies killed a month, making it 4,000 babies killed each day, or one baby killed every 20 seconds, that is so amazingly awful.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	That is basically one murder happening every 20 seconds.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	How brutal.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	The fact that life begins at conception is spiritually right.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	As it says in the Bible; Jeremiah 1:5 says, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	” The Bible says that life begins at conception, meaning that right at conception the baby becomes a living human being.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	There are many Bible verses that back up the fact that life begins at conception, like the one I just said.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	That Bible verse, Jeremiah 1:5 is saying that God intended a unique human being, starting at conception.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	Just because you can’t see or feel the baby inside of you, doesn’t mean it’s not a baby, and alive and a human being, just like you.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	That is what a lot of people do not think about, even though you really should.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	There also is scientific proof.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	Some people may think that life begins at birth, or some people even later, but that is wrong, life begins at conception.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	Because of the fact that the baby forms gradually after conception, then conception is the only real point where you can say that the baby is a living human being.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	For example, the heart beat starts gradually, over a period of time so conception is the only exact starting point of life.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	Also, DNA defines a separate human being, and so when does a person form their own DNA?
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	A person gets their own DNA at conception.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	That is a whole lot of proof, so it is just like saying it is a crime to kill a 1 year old, so why isn’t it a crime to kill a baby when he or she is still in the mother’s womb?
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	That is a question that probably will go unanswered forever, or they will just say that the baby is not living, which is a complete lie.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	Now, what can we do about abortion?
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	There many things that we can do about abortion.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	If you start supporting this pro-life movement then it will keep growing so much then no one will have an abortion.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	Hopefully then the abortion clinics will shut down, and the law will have to change.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	But, most importantly you can change the hearts of the people who support abortion, and save the innocent little babies.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	Now, how can we stop abortion?
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	There are many ways to help stop abortion.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	Another way is you can donate money to a place like The Pregnancy Resource Center and they will use it to buy an ultrasound machine and to then show the women their babies to try to convince them not to have an abortion.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	You can also write to the president or another government representative, and tell them about all this proof that I have told you, hoping that their hearts will change and then the law.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	In conclusion to all of this, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, and scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	There are many ways that you can help stop abortion, so I hope that you take a while and do that.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	There are a lot of things wrong with having an abortion, so you really should not have one.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	Just remember that God loves the person getting the abortion AND the beautiful, innocent little babies.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	Thank you and I hope that you have realized that life begins at conception, you should help the pro-life movement, and that having an abortion is wrong.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	106	My own mother has 6 children and has never had an abortion!
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	107	Life doesn't begin at conception.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	107	A pregnancy is a PROCESS of creating a life.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	107	This process begins with CONCEPTION.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	107	So conception is merely the beginning of a process.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	107	Before the fetus can actually be kept alive outside of the mother's womb by society, then the mother alone must have the choice.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	107	Society should not take away her choice unless society can keep it alive without her.
khaOs	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	108	There is a VERY simple answer to the abortion debate:Abortion should NOT be a form of birth control.
khaOs	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	108	It should ONLY be allowed (as a final solution) in the event of a pregnancy resulting from rape, incest, or other sexual crime.
NVYN	khaOs	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	109	That sounds like YOUR solution to a minority of people.
NVYN	khaOs	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	109	Don't you dare make everyone abide by the minority's rules.
NVYN	khaOs	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	109	If it was a simple answer, it wouldn't be such a huge issue.
NVYN	khaOs	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	109	Abortion isn't a form of birth control like condoms or the pill, for those directly involved it's a difficult choice that they have to make because bringing a human life up is no easy task.
NVYN	khaOs	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	109	It's not like having a pet (and even that is a big ask because not all pet owners are responsible).
NVYN	khaOs	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	109	Again, it's the choice of those directly involved.
NVYN	khaOs	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	109	It doesn't affect anybody else's life, so leave it alone.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	110	Of all the arguments I have made about this issue I think it comes down to this simple fact; Abortion should be banned because the most dangerous place in America shouldn't be the womb.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	110	I say this because statistically speaking more human beings are killed there everyday than anywhere else.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	110	That in my opinion simply should not be.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	I would like to offer some clarification on the question "can I kill it" and the follow-up question "what is it"As I have stated before; the taking of human life requires a high level of justification.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	No argument that I've seen for abortion rises to the level of proper justification.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	Please note what I'm discussing; the taking of human life, not any life but human life in particular.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	So what does that have to do with the question "can I kill it" That question needs to be clarified; hence the follow up question.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	What I want you to notice is what kind of question "what is it" is.  It is an ontological question.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	We're asking about the very nature of the thing in question.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	And that's important because it determines how we answer the first question.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	But notice this is a strictly ontological question; it is not a question about level of dependence or development.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	Why is that important?
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	Because if the thing in question, ontologically speaking, is human then it requires a high level of justification to kill it.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	If it's not human, no justification is necessary.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	I'm not saying if it's human you can't kill it, sometimes you can and must but you must properly justify your actions.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	This is were abortion fails because the only reason it gives for the most part is because the mother just choose to.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	And yes I'm sure she went through some tough decisions but bottom line; she wants to.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	Because the fact is she doesn't have to; she has other options.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	But what happens when you kill without proper justification?
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	You have to find a way to justify the act because your conscience is smitting you.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	This is always done by making the victim less than human or not human at all.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	Because after all if it's not human, no justification is necessary.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	And this is were I have seen all the arguments for abortion go.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	They leave the ontological question and move to other areas that are more easily justifiable.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	Most of them are framed like this:can I kill it?
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	What is it?
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	it's just a. . . .
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	Well of course you canThey all answer yes by qualifying the object by something that is easier to justify; a standard that is lower not higher.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	But let's answer the question head on and notice how the gravity of the question changes when we answer the follow-up question correctly.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	And by correctly I mean answering the question according to the kind of question it is, an ontological question.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	can I kill it?
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	What is it?
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	It's a human, one at the very early stages of it's development.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	So let's take the question of this debate head on; Should abortion be banned?
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	What is abortion?
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	The taking of a human life at the very early stages of it's development.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	Why would you want to do that?
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	Because I don't want the inconvenience of a child.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	Does that sound like proper justification for the taking of human life, especially the weakest and most vulnerable human life?
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	I have reduced, intentionally, all reasons for an abortion to a matter of convenience because ultimately that's what it comes down to.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	If a pregnancy, regardless of how it came about, stands between you and what you want it's an inconvenience; and we all know what we do with inconveniences.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	But this one is a little sticker because it's human.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	But if we can take away or cloud it's humanity then it will be easier to do.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	So should abortion be banned?
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	111	Of course it should, for obvious reasons.
trisha	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	112	No on ehas the right to take awaysomeones life or decide if they liveor not.
trisha	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	112	by getting rid of an unborn baby it isdestroying potential and you will alwaysthink of what could have been.
Kiimeh	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	113	The fundamental issue regarding the abortion debate is not women's rights or other factors which concern personal autonomy, but over the status of the unborn child.
Kiimeh	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	113	Variants of the personal choice argument presuppose that the unborn child is not a human person, for if the unborn child is indeed a human person, then no amount of freedom justifies its elective termination.
Kiimeh	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	113	Henceforth, variants of the personal autonomy argument beg the question by presupposing their conclusions: they are valid if and only if the unborn are not human persons.
Kiimeh	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	113	First premise is that it is prima facie morally wrong to kill any person.
Kiimeh	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	113	Jane English makes an interesting point that this is not always the case.
Kiimeh	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	113	For example, would not self-defense be a legitimate example of when killing a person is justified?
Kiimeh	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	113	However, the abortion opponent could also claim that fetus' are innocent entities, but even then prima facie it would seem that self-defense would still be legitimate.
Kiimeh	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	113	A fetus is a person because it posses "intrinsic potentials".
Kiimeh	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	113	However, before that he admits that an argument that shows unborn are persons because they have the persons to become persons is absurd.

Hellno2012	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	117	Absolutely!
Hellno2012	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	117	Except for cases of rape, incest, and when the life of the mother is at stake.
Animegirl300	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	118	I think that stupid teenagers and even older women who decided to have sex when they KNEW they couldn't afford a baby should be restricted from it unless there is a medical problem with the mother.
ScorpioLady1	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	119	I think abortion should be banned because if they didn't want the baby in the first place they shouldn't have opened their legs, should've used a condom, started birth control, used spermicide, etc.  There are many other options such as giving the baby up for adoption!
ScorpioLady1	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	119	If you don't understand they are killing the baby while the baby is still alive and forming.
ScorpioLady1	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	119	The baby can move, feel, cry, etc.  Why would you want to kill a innocent child?
ScorpioLady1	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	119	That's so wrong.
Zurbaby6711	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	120	i think abortion is a very bad idea.
Zurbaby6711	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	120	it's killing someone.
Zurbaby6711	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	120	if you didn't want a child, your stupid ass should've used a condom.
Zurbaby6711	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	120	chruch is highly agaisnt abortion.
Zurbaby6711	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	120	go to the freakin teen clinic your horny ass need a condom!
Zurbaby6711	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	120	they're free there.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	"I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	"So a thirteen year old girl gets raped, and you're saying that the govenrment have the right to force that girl to keep her unwanted baby?
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	I would imagine the girl would never really bond with her baby, and the child would have to grow up knowing of its conception and live with the knowledge that it was not wanted.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	Surely that is justification enough?
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	That is not a life anyone would want, and surely aborting that baby in its early stages of development would be the better thing to do.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	Also, think of the number of children that would end up in care if abortion was banned.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	There are enough of them already, the banning of abortion would most definately increase this number, and the more children in care, the lower the quality would become.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	Where would they get the money to look after so many children?
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	Our taxes?
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	It would get rediculous, and there would be a lot of children out there wishing they had never been born.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	I do realise that there are problems with abortion, for example, the amount of people who have unsafe sex because they know they can either take the morning after pill or have an abortion is rediculous.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	But, I'd like to know that if the contraception i was using didn't work and I fell pregnant through no fault of my own, I would be very happy that I have the option to have an abortion.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	Also, when do you begin to class a fetus as a human?
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	I personally would not think of it as a human untill about 12 weeks.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	It doesnt even enter the fetal stage untill the 11th week, surely abortion before this stage is not inhumane?
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	If there was a contraception out there that was 100% effective, then this would be a more valid arguement.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	I'm young, and have dreams and aspirations that I could never fulfill if I became pregnant.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	If contraception can't garrentee that i won't get pregnant, I definately want the choice to have an abortion if i needed one.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	You're view seems to be very black and white, and you seem to dismiss the huge grey area that exists.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	121	Abortion exists for a reason and should not be banned
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	122	Let me clarify my position, since I misstated it.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	122	The first question that needs to be asked is " what kind of life is it?
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	122	" If it is a human life then no reason for abortion is adequate.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	122	Therefore no further questions are needed.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	122	I find it rather disturbing that we want to have sex without commitments so badly that we are willing to kill the result of that sexual union.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	122	But isn't that just like human nature, everything is just fine until something conflicts with what we want and stands between us and what we desire.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	122	Then laws get broke, peace treaties ignored, property taken and people killed.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	122	But the most heinous crime is when we make laws to exonerate ourselves.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	122	When we call evil, good.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	122	We may be guiltless before the law but that doesn't mean we are not without real quilt.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	122	But praise be to God that He has provided a solution to the two greatest problems man faces, guilt and death.
sadyrkulova	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	122	With God there is forgiveness, but not without great cost.
Brrrannndi	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	123	Yes, abortion should be banned.
Brrrannndi	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	123	What about adoption?
Brrrannndi	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	123	They need to stand up for the mistake they made and have the baby, and if it is unwanted, put it up for adoption.
Brrrannndi	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	123	Just don't kill it.
Brrrannndi	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	123	I understand that the baby really isn't a baby yet but if a baby isn't wanted, then the person needs to have safe sex.
Brrrannndi	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	123	It isn't the baby's fault.
asdf789	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	124	I say they should, but it depends.
asdf789	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	124	If the woman got raped or a mother could die, I could see some instances where they should not be banned.
asdf789	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	124	But basically everything else to me should be banned.
asdf789	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	124	So, due to majority, I will say it should be banned :).
asdf789	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	124	The term abstinence has apparently become extinct these days.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	125	I agree with you except on the issue of rape.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	125	Why should the child be killed for a crime they didn't commit?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	126	Why should the woman carry out the child for a crime in which she was a victim and for a child she did not want to have?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	126	It could go both ways.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	126	Leave it up to the woman to decide.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	127	Abortion for Rape Victims?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	127	By Gregory KouklIf we allowed an abortion under those circumstances it would send a terrible message, that when someone reminds you of something extremely painful you can eliminate them.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	127	But you can't kill another human being just because their existence makes your life physically or emotionally burdensome.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	127	If I had a law on my desk that restricted abortion except in the cases of rape or incest I would sign it, even though I don't think rape and incest ought to be exceptions.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	127	I'd just rather save 98% of the children whose lives are taken through abortion rather than none.

asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	128	You are assuming from a Christian article that everyone in the world must believe in Christianity, which can't happen because God gave man free will.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	128	Of course it is not morally right if you are a Christian, but not everyone is a Christian and you have to respect their rights as well.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	128	Did not Jesus command, 'love your neighbor as yourself'?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	128	Your neighbor could be a Christian, atheist, wiccan, whatever, could they not?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	128	It is not up to you to judge someone, leave that to God.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	128	No matter what you do or say, people will continue to have abortions in the world.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	128	It is an unfortunate fact of life, similar to war, similar to racism, similar to obesity.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	128	You see them committing a sin and loudly call them out, but you are being hypocritical because you also sin.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	128	You are saying that you are perfect and never sin, which, unless you are Jesus coming back down again, is impossible.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	128	I am a Christian as well, but I realize that it is wrong to judge and criticize someone for sinning when I do the same thing as well, albeit a different type.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	128	Like I said earlier, leave the judging to God.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	So let me see if I understand you.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	Killing children isn't actually wrong.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	It is only if you believe it is.  So what Hitler did was good because he thought it was.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	And it would be good, by your logic, to kill you so long as I believed it was right.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	Since when does right and wrong depend on what one believes?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	This is certainly not the view of right and wrong that Jesus of Nazareth held.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	To be a follower of Him means to hold the same worldview has he does.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	About loving: To love someone means to seek the very best for them and protect them from what harms them, You can't say you love someone and then stand by when they are being harmed when it is within your power to do something.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	Humans in the early stages of life just happen to be your neighbor.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	Go back and read the passage on the Good Samaritan.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	Your position is the one the Pharisee took and the one Jesus condemned.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	about judging: The passage of scripture were Jesus deals with judging doesn't condemn judging nor forbid it.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	It does condemn judging hypocritically however.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	It then goes on to say " first remove the log from your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers"If judging is wrong for you?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	why did you judge what I wrote?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	are you saying that you are perfect and never sin?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	129	I guess you don't leave the judging to God do you.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	130	No, you are way out in left field.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	130	Stop the red herrings and keep it to the topic.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	130	What does Hitler have to do with abortions?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	130	As I said earlier, one of two commandments to adhere to as a Christian (that Jesus said himself in the gospels) is to love your neighbor as yourself.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	130	Let me ask you, what did Jesus believe about abortions, since you feel that my interpretation is not right?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	130	What is the view of right and wrong according to Jesus of Nazareth?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	130	You stand by and watch people kill each other during war.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	130	What kind of love is this?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	130	Yes, you can do something concerning abortions.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	130	Judging them as a murderer however does not encompass this.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	130	That is the main point of my argument.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	130	I am saying you cannot judge someone to be murderer and that they are automatically going to hell because they have an abortion.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	130	What do you mean by 'judging what I wrote'?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	130	Judging to me is calling a male gay because he wears pink, calling a person retarded because they fail a grade in school, and calling a person hell-bound who has an abortion.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	130	Apparently you did not read the last part of my statement concerning sin.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	130	Also, I need to know what your definition of judging is, since you disagree with mine.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	131	Lets see Hitler killed people.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	131	abortions kill people.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	131	Wow your right, no correlation at all, a true red herring.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	131	Want to know what Jesus taught about abortion, right and wrong and judging people?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	131	Go get your Bible and knock off the dust because it would be wise to ask Him not me. Final thought; We are all lawbreakers and apart from the grace of God, all of us are going to prison for a long time for comic treason.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	131	And since the one we offended is infinite in worth, the debt we owe is infinite also.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	131	So consider what infinity minus 10 thousand is, infinity.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	131	That's how long it will take to pay the debt.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	131	But that's not the question at hand is it; it's about abortion.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	131	And for that there is only one question; what's being killed?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	131	If it's not human, no justification is necessary.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	131	No one needs justification to remove a tumor do they?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	131	But if it's a human being killed in an abortion then no justification is adequate.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	131	So if you think abortions shouldn't be banned, please tell me exactly what is being killed in an abortion,
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	Hitler was a murderer for having abortions?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	Like I said, keep it to the topic.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	Hmm, lets see.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	You dispute me, I ask for evidence as to why you dispute me, you come up with "go check the Bible.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	" I'm still waiting for the evidence.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	I ask two simple questions.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	What did Jesus say about abortions?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	What is right and wrong according to Jesus?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	I mean, if you want to cop out and not answer them, you shouldn't keep the debate going, since you were the one who disputed me. We are all lawbreakers.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	So how should one type of sin get emphasized over the other?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	God looks at every sin the same way, except for blasphemy against HS.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	A person who commits a murder commits the same sin in the eyes of God as someone who lies.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	Why are you trying to deny it?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	You have no right to tell someone that their sin is worse than yours, because you are not God, and God does not judge sins that way except for one, blasphemy against HS.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	"Go get your Bible" if you think I am wrong.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	I can't keep arguing with you if you continue to take the debate off topic.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	We are talking specifically about whether you should judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	I have said this throughout my past statements, yet you want to keep diverting the topic to something you feel comfortable with.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	I put my first statement under the 'abortions should be banned' view for a reason.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	The question is not about what is being killed in an abortion.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	Obviously it is a human being imo.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	Again, stop cop-ing out and keep it to the topic.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	132	Should you judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	The funny thing is you say that I say a whole lot of things that I can't find in the things I write.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	Maybe you could help me out and tell me were I said such things like: "Hitler was a murderer for having abortions""You have no right to tell someone that their sin is worse than yours".
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	I said that?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	"Should you judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	" Were did i do that?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	I thought the question was; Should abortion be banned.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	And help me with this one: "We are talking specifically about whether you should judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	"Who is judging someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	Please show me were I said that.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	Just for the record; my view is that everyone of us, apart from the grace of Jesus Christ, is hell bound for the high crime of cosmic treason, aka idolatry.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	Romans 1:18-25Romans 1:25 who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	Amen.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	If I remember correctly you responded to a post I made quoting Greg Koukl who i thought made a very good point regarding the question of this debate and you responded with, you can't use that, it's Christian.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	How very judgmental of you.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	Anyway, since your not to familiar with what scripture teaches.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	I'll help you out.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	And note the part were Jesus says you shall not murder.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	About right and wrong; notice that Jesus quoted the Ten Commandments here.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	That's an objective standard, not a subjective one as you suggest.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	And he says in the last passage that all men will be judged by this law.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	That means it applies to all men, at all times and in all places.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	that is the polar opposite of what you say.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	So one of you has got to be wrong.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	Matthew 19:17-1917 So He said to him, “Why do you call Me good?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	No one is good but One, that is, God.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	”18 He said to Him, “Which ones?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	”Jesus said, “ ‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’ 19 ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	133	’”Matthew 5:20For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	infer (v)- to derive by reasoning; conclude or judge from premises or evidence-----I have stated in my previous arguments that you should not judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion, and you disputed my argument.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	Therefore, I can infer that you are against what I have said.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	----I can see now that we have been arguing two different questions.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	The question is not about whether abortions should be banned or not.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	I already answered that they should, with there being exceptions for special circumstances.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	One of those special circumstances I mentioned was rape, and you disputed me on that circumstance.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	That does not mean that I am against abortions being banned; I would like for that to happen.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	I think you got mixed up when I said that and inferred wrongly.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	-----Practically all Christians are against abortions, because it goes against what the Bible says.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	I am against them too, however I do not believe it is right to judge someone in a negative manner if they do have an abortion.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	The same goes for gays as well concerning harassment.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	You shouldn't judge someone, period.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	When you judge someone, it eventually leads to hate, and God will not forgive you if you do not forgive you neighbor for what they have done.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	People make bad decisions every day.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	Their (people having abortions) sin should not be ridiculed upon or emphasized as one of the worst sins, because we also commit sin, and God looks at every sin the same way, except for the one I mentioned in my previous statement.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	You should tell them that what they are doing is sinful and pray for them, but I don't believe you should harass them and look down upon them for what they have done.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	-----I am inferring that you are a Christian, although I may be wrong.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	Could you specify what religion you follow?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	I am a nondenominational evangelical.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	-----I get what you are saying with Romans 1:18-25, but what you fail to realize is that although a person has an abortion, that does not mean that they cannot be forgiven of it and become Christians later on.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	The only sin in which you cannot be forgiven is blasphemy against the HS (Mark 3:29).
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	You should not degrade them for what they have done, but encourage them to turn to God so that He can forgive them of their past wrongdoings.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	-----How very judgmental of you.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	You took it out of context.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	Read the entire paragraph and you will see my response.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	I also put in in bold in response to your other statement.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	-----Anyway, since your not to familiar with what scripture teaches.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	Wow, and you are calling me judgmental.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	-----note the part were Jesus says you shall not murder.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	About right and wrong; notice that Jesus quoted the Ten Commandments here.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	Jesus condensed them into two commandments for Christians to follow.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	See Matthew 22:36-40.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	They revolve around love, not murder.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	-----Hmmm.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	so let me see here.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	According to the verses you mentioned, you believe that you must follow the Ten Commandments in order to have eternal life?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	I want to make sure I understand your point of view, because I disagree with it if it is so.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	Romans 10:9,10"If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	"Ephesians 2:8,9:"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from youselves, it is the gift of God--not by works, so that no one can boast.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do"I can't go on until I know which religion you follow, but it is clear from these two verses that if you are a Christian, you are saved by faith in God, not by obeying the Ten Commandments.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	Paul touches on this in his letters.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	134	I don't have the time right now to look them all up, but I will list them later on if you would like me to.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	You are correct in your assessment of me.  Doctrinally I consider myself a Reformed Baptist, but primarily a follower of the historical Jesus of Nazareth.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	I also think we agree for the most part, however I took exception with several things you said because I found them to be inconsistent with a Christian World-view.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	Primarily your statement that Christian morality applies solely to Christians.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	That is known as moral relativism (for a full discussion of this please see the book by Francis J.  Beckwith and Greg Koukl titled: Relativism: Feet Firmly Planted in Mid-Air ) The scripture I quoted was to make the point that morality, according to Jesus, was objective.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	I was very explicit about that; to infer anything beyond that is to read into what I said something that is not there.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	I also took and take exception to your insistence that we are commanded not to judge.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	The only thing I can find is a command not to judge hypocritically and then a command to judge once we have dealt with our own sin.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	I do agree with your sentiment of judgmentalism and the holier than thou attitude I think your are trying to address.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	If we are saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone then we have nothing in which to boast.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	Even the faith I have is a gift from God Ephesians 2:8 I am by nature a murderer and hell bound sinner and deserving of the wrath of God, but I have received mercy and I 'm now commanded to go and show mercy as I have been shown mercy.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	But I ask how are we to fulfill the great commission if we first don't judge that people are murderers( see the sermon on the mount) and hell-bound?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	If there is no peril, there is no need of a savior and no need to warn people.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	And that means that Jesus died in vain.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	But Jesus made a judgment, people are murderers and hell-bound and it matters not how they got there, only that they need to be saved.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	And He asked me to go for Him and seek and save that which is lost.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	If I'm His follower than I'll do what he commands me. “If you love Me, keep My commandments" John 14:15Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	” Amen.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	135	Matthew 28:19-20
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	No, as a Christian, I believe the morality that God gave and still gives applies to everyone of every race, regardless of religion.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	There is no such thing as another religion, for they are committing idolatry.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	Either you interpreted my statement wrongly or I misspoke.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	I don't believe morals are relative to peoples of a certain religion or a certain culture.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	If I did, I wouldn't be a Christian because I would be contradicting myself and my beliefs.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	I think it is important that we go over the verses in question and see the meaning behind it.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	Matthew 7:1-5"Stop judging others and you will not be judged.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	For others will treat you as you treat them.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	Whatever measure you use in judging others, it will be used to measure how you are judged.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye when you have a log in your own?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	How can you think of saying, 'let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	Hypocrite!
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	First get rid of the log from your own eye; then perhaps you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	"My interpretation of these verses are that Jesus is warning you from judging someone else for their sin when you sin even worse, in other words being hypocritical.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	Now, as a Christian, it is your duty in Matthew 18:15-17 to kindly confront the person about what they have done, with the goal being to bring repentance in that person (James 5:20).
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	You could also look at 2 Timothy 4:2, where it says that you should kindly correct, rebuke, and encourage with good teaching.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	You see what I am saying?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	You are not to judge someone, but to rather point out the truth to them so that James 5:20 can occur.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	To kindly come up to someone and tell them that what they are doing is wrong for the purpose of bringing them closer to Christ is not the same as pronouncing judgment upon someone.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	We are to judge thesinas murder, and always with the goal of helping thepersonsee that Jesus is a solution for the consequences of sin.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	Now, if I go up to someone who commits an abortion and yell at them that they are going to hell for being a murderer, what does that solve?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	It doesn't solve anything.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	This is the kind of hypocritical judgment Jesus was talking about in Matthew 7.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	On the other hand, if you kindly go up to the person, show them where they made the mistake, tell them that they can be forgiven of it with the blood of Jesus Christ, and send them on their way, you plant the seed in them in which they can hopefully come to Jesus.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	136	Of course, it is up to them to decide, but by showing them the solution to the problem, you have a much greater chance of that person coming to grips with what they have done, and then turning to Jesus and becoming saved.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	137	Palinin,Help me with something if you can.
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	137	As I read back through this debate something odd jumped out at me.  You dismiss and ignore every point I raise and then expect me to answer every point you raise; why is that?
jstantall	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	137	waiting for a response.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	138	There is a difference between refuting and ignoring.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	138	I addressed every point you made and didn't keep bringing up topics that were irrelevant to the debate, such as Hitler.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	138	Abortion for Rape Victims?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	138	By Gregory KouklYou are assuming from a Christian article that everyone in the world must believe in Christianity,which can't happen because God gave man free will.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	138	So what Hitler did was good because he thought it was.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	138	What does Hitler have to do with abortions?
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	138	To be a follower of Him means to hold the same worldview has he does.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	138	As I said earlier, one of two commandments to adhere to as a Christian (that Jesus said himself in the gospels) is to love your neighbor as yourself.
asdf789	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	138	We are all lawbreakers and apart from the grace of GodWe are all lawbreakers.

asdf789	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	143	Prev, show me how this has to deal directly with abortions being banned and I will answer it.
asdf789	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	143	I think you meant Afghanistan now anyways, we are pulling out of Iraq.
Prevaricate	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	144	attn Palinin2040:the double standard used by many anti-abortionist/pro-lifers makes me kinda blah about the so-called abortion debate [just give 'em education and contraception and watch the number of abortions drop]they wail-n-moan about innocents murdered in the womb (something the government has nothing to do with in comparison to war) but turn a blind eye every time a bullet or bomb.
Prevaricate	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	144	that they paid for, kills murders an innocent Iraqi or Afghan childwhy even bother discussing the thousands of Vietnamese killed in "free fire zones" and during "carpet bombing" raidsa young woman decides to "kill" her baby and the "lifers" don sack clothes and ashes.
Prevaricate	asdf789	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	144	your government kills and the "lifers" rally behind the flag and cry patriotismthank goodness this rank hypocrisy is being well documented and will not be erased from history
asdf789	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	145	To sum up your argument:Pro-lifers are hypocrites because they oppose the killing of babies from abortions while approving of the killing of babies during war.
asdf789	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	145	I understand your viewpoint, but I disagree with it.
asdf789	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	145	I don't approve of war at all, and I am pro-life for the most part.
asdf789	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	145	There are other people just like me as well, but you said many, so you are pretty much correct in your reasoning.
August	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	146	That is not even the argument.
August	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	146	We are debating abortion not the war in iraq.
NVYN	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	147	The debate is about abortions, which is about the act of stopping an unwanted pregnancy from developing into a life.
NVYN	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	147	Pro-lifers are arguing that abortions are killing lives which is what war is! ! !
NVYN	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	147	So what pro-lifers wanna do is put a ban on wars instead of abortions, since wars are killing actual lives and ruining many others, whereas abortions are just potential lives and not actual lives.
NVYN	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	147	Put a ban on wars and you'll free up so much money spent on defense every year!
NVYN	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	147	Why do you worry about abortions so much when the world population is not exactly dwindling.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	148	Well, once it is a child, it already is illegal to kill it.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	148	Before the first tri-mester it's a cluster of cells with no more self-awareness than a kitchen table.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	148	So that wouldn't be "killing a child" at all.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	148	And don't start with the potential bs.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	148	Because by that logic you would also have to outlaw masterbation, and save every ejaculation in a cup separating out the thousands of sperms representing "potential" life and finding female eggs to inject them in.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	148	'course judging by your past arguement, I guess you'll try anyway.
NVYN	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	149	I would go as far as saying that before the fetus can digest milk (which means it can be sustained without direct connection to the mother via the umbilical cord), it is a dependent part of the mother like any other organ and she should have the choice to remove it.
NVYN	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	149	After that, society could have a say (because society can theoretically keep it alive with milk).
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	150	Yes, you are absolutely right, it is illegal to kill a child, but just because it a simple "cluster of cells" in the early stages of pregnancy, does that give us any further right to destroy it?
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	150	Not convinced?
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	150	Perhaps this example will help my point:You are walking through a farm one day, and you stumble upon a chicken egg that has been freshly laid.
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	150	You step on it, and guess what?
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	150	You have commited murder!
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	150	I instantly know the reply to that statement, after all, it's just an egg, so therefore there isn't any developed life growing inside.
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	150	yet!
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	150	It doesn't matter how far the stages of development have gone, because there is ultimately going to be a child, and forcing an early abortion is the prevention of life, and in my eyes, is nothing short of an abortion at say the six month stage of a human pregnancy.
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	150	By the way, if I may add this, then I would say that your view on the "potential bs," and how we should "outlaw masterbation," is either incredibly misguided, or incredibly stupid.
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	150	Need I remind you that there are several billion sperm cells in each male.
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	150	So, how many sperm cells are produced during the process of masterbation?
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	150	I certainly wouldn't think billions, millions, or even several thousands!
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	151	Oh jeez,I don't know where you and that J whatever guy came from, but your critical thinking skills are absolutely awful on this topic.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	151	My point about the thousands of potential lives every time a guy cums are accurate.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	151	There are thousands of sperm, each "potentially" able to make a life if it finds an egg.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	151	This is every time a guy cums.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	151	Look it up.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	151	There stored in you, if you don't jack it or screw they're dissolved in the body or come out in your sleep.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	151	But it's a sperm holocaust literally everyday within our bodies.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	151	And I used that example to show J whatever exactly how silly the "potential" life argument is. Potential life is not a legitimate excuse against abortion.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	151	Because, exactly.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	151	like.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	151	I. . .  said.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	151	we destroy thousands of potential lives every single time we masturbate, or don't masturbate, or even when we do have sex.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	151	Now, reread this twice if you feel a need to reply, and consult a dictionary if you have to, I'm tired of having to over-explain the simplest things.

SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	153	Ok. You're now officially making ludicrous points.
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	153	Congrats.
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	153	Gargantuous isn't even close to the word which is used to describe the difference between a sperm cell and an unborn fetus: A sperm cell has not yet entered the fertilisation process; a fetus has.
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	153	You said it yourself: There are thousands of sperm.
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	153	There are also many eggs in a female.
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	153	If you masterbate, it isn't the end of the sperm world!
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	153	There are still going to be thousands upon thousands more and ready to be concieved!
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	153	So please do not BS this debate and say that sperm = fetus, because it is completely wrong.
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	153	Lose a sperm cell, no big deal; lose a fetus, there is something to be concerned with.
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	153	No need to over-explain, your whole argument was wrong anyway.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	154	Hey, sperm does not equal fetus.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	154	What iamdavidh is trying to say is that sperm equals same category as fetus!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	154	SAME CATEGORY!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	154	POTENTIAL LIFE!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	154	get it?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	154	I'll say it again: IT'S NOT A PERSON LIKE YOU AND I WHO CAN ASK "WHY" OR "HOW".
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	154	The fetus is a "thing".
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	154	It's parasitic in relationship with its host.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	154	It can feel pain?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	154	My arm can feel pain!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	154	My arm has all the human DNA to make another human being, so do sperms and eggs.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	154	The fetus can certainly become a person but before it does, it's NOT.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	154	NOT A PERSON!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	154	P. O. T. E. N. T. I. A. L.  ONLY!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	155	Well I'm sorry (not literally) that you feel so categorical towards the development of human life.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	155	Some of us, who actually believe in a reproduction with effort, look at a fetus AS HUMAN LIFE.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	155	While it may be a scrambled cluster of cells, it is already developing beyond the category of "potential," regardless of self-awareness.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	155	Any scientist will tell you what reproduction means the world to the human race.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	155	Maybe it's a parasite to you, but it's something completely different in the end isn't it?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	155	Look, I don't care about all this BS with "what is a child and what isn't," it isn't even the point of my argument.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	155	My point is that a child cannot voice an opinion, and that sometimes, to prevent the worst, someone has to voice it for them.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	155	If we were all like you, saying that it should be completely up to the mother, then there'll be no need to second guess how the population will be affected.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	155	For all you know, you could be aborting the next 'potential' President, or the next 'potential' anything!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	155	No-one can say how that'll change things, after all, the only means of comparison has just been scraped out of a woman's womb.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	155	So Mr.  Potential, have a nice day, and have a hard, long think about the 'potential life' that isn't even given the chance to survive!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	156	The reason I'm breaking it all down for all you pro-life people is that YOU ALL feel the need to project YOUR GUILT on others who has the view that they're not killing a person!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	156	It's your guilt, not others'.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	156	Feel it yourself!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	156	Go to confession if you're Catholic.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	156	Do whatever you need to do.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	156	You all keep telling us that it's murder!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	156	I can safely say that about 9/10 arguments found on here are based upon that ONE SINGLE point, which may I add is completely incorrect!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	156	It's how we see it.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	156	If you don't like that, then we pity you.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	156	Just don't force your view on us and then try to push for a law that govern our lives too!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	156	Reproduction means the world to the human race?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	156	What about unchecked reproduction like in China and India where the one child policy has created more problems and actual murders then is necessary?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	156	We all agree that at the end of the 9 months it's an actual human life.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	156	I actually made the point that at week 20 it has a slight chance of survival and should be saved, as society can now intervene.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	157	"You all keep telling us that it's murder!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	157	"Murder is not the word that I would use.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	157	I see an abortion as an unnecessary decision, one which could have been prevented but instead has been inconsiderately acted upon.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	157	Instead of hitting the problem on the head, we are circling the issue.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	157	By this I refer to the fact that an unwanted pregnancy is the source of the problem, yet we do nothing to stop this issue; instead, we are nailing the leaf and not the stem by aborting the unwanted child.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	157	So, while unwanted pregnancies climb, so do the rate of abortion.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	157	Were we to actually decide that we should perhaps try to solve the problem of unwanted pregnancies, we would finally be making a difference.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	157	We just need to make certain that education finds a way to influence the minds of all teens and couples, so that an unwanted pregnancy becomes a thing of the past, as will abortion.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	157	Then we simply push abortion to the side, as we will have finally killed a major weed in the garden of life.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	157	In another argument, you stated that we should instead outlaw unprotected sex, which is thebiggest amount of BS that I have heard in this debate!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	157	Think about it: suddenly we are no longer able to freely create as we please, pro-creation becomes a thing of the past, and the rate of childbirth drops in the high thousands.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	157	And as for 'fining' unprotected sex or using 'jail-time' as a punishment; that isjust plain stupid.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	157	The Governmentcanhave a say in education, but theycannotexamine each and every couple for a condom each and every time that they have sex.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	157	It would be a full time job with prostitutes.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	157	So, hopefully I've cleared up a few things, and hopefully you finally understand where I am coming from.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	158	Ok, if you really want to "hit the problem on the head" or "nail the stem" then what you want to do is deal with unprotected sex!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	158	That's where the source of the problem is, a pregnancy is the result of THAT!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	158	You don't see that?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	158	You go on and on and on about education, which I'm not opposing at all.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	158	I'm all for education.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	158	What you've failed to do is come up with any feasible educational solution at all, then you even reject my best suggestion to deal with the problem at hand, and you reject it with your BS logic that makes no sense.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	158	Your only answer to this thing is making abortion illegal, that's a great solution pal!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	158	Way to deal with everything!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	158	Let's just make everything illegal, even if only a portion of the community FEELS it should be!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	158	You people make me sick!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	You know what, these are my last few arguments, because now you are just personally attacking me, whether it is intentional or not.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	One thing you have derived from my arguments is that education is vital to the solution, and yet, you haven't pieced it all together.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Since I have to do everything around here, here's my core arguments:Abortion is a problem, not a solution.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	The whole situation leads to back to a crisis that has been occurring for many years now.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	The problem: unwanted pregnancies, most of which are occurring between young couples such as teenagers, who feel that it is 'ok' to experiment every now and then.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	They lack safety, they lack education; see where I am getting at?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Sure, we can pull everyone into a booooooooring seminar about how 'important' the body is and how we should always 'be safe,' but that just isn't working.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Now, if we finally came up with a working educational system, then, perhaps, we could make some progress.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	This can done in a few simple ways: one of which is using personal examples.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	I remember watching an episode of Maury Povich, which showed several teen girls (all who were around 14 years of age) who thought that it was ok for them to become pregnant, and, in fact, were insisting that they were planning on immediate impregnation.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Maury brought out a guest speaker, an ex-prostitute who spoke to those girls in ways that shocked me.  She told them what would happen, and didn't spare a single detail.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Guess what?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	By the end of it all, those girls had broken their sexual habits and moved on to live better lives.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Now, this is over-dramatic in most cases, but the fact is that the system works, and it has been proved.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Here, we have literally "hit the problem on the head," and have actually made a valuable difference.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Rather than have an attitude of "oh, if it happens, we'll just flush it out," we can actually stop the whole process together.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Then, after the situation has come to a resting stop, we sweep away the excess of what was abortion and move on in our lives.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	You see, though I argue for abortions to be made illegal, I don't use terms as rushed and as provocative like that.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	What I suggest will prove that abortions are unnecessary, and can be removed from the system.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	If banning is the word for it, then why not?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	After all, it's not like anyone is going to be using it!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Now, you made a strong point that I found hard to deal with, that it is a mothers right to make a decision as to whether or not to keep the child as a part of her.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	I did my research, and found that it some cases it can be a life or death situation.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	I felt like actually agreeing with you for a while there, and in some ways I do, but then I came to realize that this is only a problem because wemake it a problem.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	You're right, before the 20 week stage it is incapable of survival, and sure, even beyond that point it is still iffy.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	What we can derive from that is that a baby is never a sure thing, which is fair and true.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	That however, is not an excuse.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	I mean, sure, we canguessthat it may not survive, we canguessthat it may be a problem for both the mother and child, but above all, we canguessthat it won't, for either case.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	You see, the problem there is that sometimes men don't get themselves 'checked,' and act upon male instinct.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Or, perhaps some women will just desire a baby, as I have already covered.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	What stands out from all this is that people don't know thefactsof sex, and howpotentialit is for a number of reasons, whether it results in a child or an exchange of STD's.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	So, there you have it!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Again, the problem is a lack of education.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Again, this can be dealt with.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Hey, while I'm here, let's look at another form of education, just for your benefit!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	What has already been shown is that the majority of unwanted pregnancies come from younger aged individuals or couples, which, sadly, does not reflect well on how the future will go.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	See, that's the thing, we can educate the older people in society, but that doesn't save the next generation doesn't it?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	One solution that has been presented over a thousand times is abstinence, which has its ups and downs.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	On one side it can stop a lot of potential unwanted pregnancies, and on the other hand, it can appear as another "uncool rule" and be totally disregarded.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	What we need to teach adolescents is that abstinence is the "better" way to do things, as hard as it may be.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	As dangerous as it may be, the Government should probably consider passing a law on abstinence (and let us get one thing straight, this isNOTthe same thing as banning unprotected sex), so that we can perhaps make things easier in the long run.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Look, you're probably going to chew this one to pieces, but just remember, even I'm not 100% on this one.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Like I said, it is just "another idea.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	"Now, before you literally "make yourself sick," understand that an abortion can sometimes "appear" as the more appropriate thing.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	1% of abortions come from rape, which is actually an issue no matter where you are in the world (maybe not in Antarctica, I think the penguins know better.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	So, rape is a problem that needs to be dealt with.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Again, abortions are just circling the issue.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Sure, we can "clean up the mistakes" all we want; that doesn't stop these problems from occurring in the first place!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	What I think you really need to understand is that abortions aren't actuallythatnecessary; it has it's benefits, but we can domuchbetter!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Again, we need to "hit the problem on the head", if we are going to actuallymake any progress!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Therefore, it is perfectly clear that the problem of rape needs to be dealt with, and seriously.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	If that takes similar tactics to those as used towards the young teens that I referred to previously, then why not?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	After all, the tactic has been proven to work?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Naturally, that doesn't kill the more serious issue of rape, therefore, the Government then needs to decide how they can cure the problem before it can potentially get any worse.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Like all things, it will take time, we all just need to be a little patient.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Perhaps, if I needed to show you how serious some of those girls actually were, then I'll provide a Youtube link to one of the girls from that episode from Maury Povich.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Understand that I am in no way stereotyping all girls like this, it is just one problem that we are facing in some cases (however small they are).
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	I'm going to ask you a simple question: Are you a woman?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Now, I will ask you a more serious question: Are you a mother?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	If you reply with two positive answers, then I would understand how "personal" the issue is.  I am male, and I am only 15, but I know more about this issue than most people would.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	I have actuallyseen an abortion,and whether I wanted it to or not, it affected me.  I then went and did my research, and I actually used this topic in several speeches that I have done in my past years at high school.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	I know for a fact that an abortion isn't funny, that it is a serious decision, and one that I think could always have been avoided.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	I'm not some kind of "pro-creationist," or someone who "forces their beliefs on others," I find myself as an educative person, because I have educated myself on this issue.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	I want to help people my own age, then both below and above, to show that "one man makes a difference," especially to an issue as serious as this.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	If my act of spreading an educative message to others is making you sick, then I, honestly, could not stand to look at myself in the mirror if I were you.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	You admit that you believe in education, yet you do nothing to prove it.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	I could easily put my fingers in my ears and yell "LALALALALA" as well, but I for one actually take what you are saying quite seriously.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	If you actually believe in education, why do continue to support the issue?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	This issue is complex, even if you won't admit it or cannot see it.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	One man can make a difference but it takes an entire nation to see that an abortion circles the problem that it was meant to fix.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Take a look at abortion, does killing what you we define as "a mistake" actually solve anything?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	159	Well, not to me it doesn't.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	Ok, I see the problem now (and it's not the fact that you're 15 because I don't care about your age or gender), it is: you are unable to form any comprehensible form of logics in any of your arguments.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	Initially I thought I was debating with someone of fair intelligence with the ability to make clear logical arguments, but that opinion has simply dissipated.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	It scares me that people like you could be in parliament affecting lots of lives.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	Here's why:You say "abortion is a problem, not a solution" - ummm this is YOUR VIEW.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	My view is that it's NOT a problem but a RESULT of unwanted pregnancies (which is the real problem (and you admit this in the next couple of sentences.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	Your point is now out the window, so let's see you actually rebut that directly with something else.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	Alas you probably will, but not with logic.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	An episode of Maury Povich?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	Is that a fictional TV show?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	You're using that as a basis for your educational system?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	FYI, the guest speaker tactic has been done to death everywhere.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	But its impact is still minimal, it's not reaching enough people.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	Again, my suggestion of putting a hefty fine on unwanted pregnancies would have more impact.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	Ok I'm not going to chew your "making a law on abstinence" to pieces, it's essentially dealing with the problem of unwanted pregnancies.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	We may have some common ground here.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	I've actually moved past the "banning unprotected sex" arguments to now suggest "making unwanted pregnancies expensive and coupling it with something rehabilitative like a compulsory education on the whole thing.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	"The problem of rape has already been dealt with.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	It's called ILLEGAL and includes a jail term.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	No need to discuss that here.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	Banning abortion wouldn't be necessary if you're actually dealing with the problem, which is unwanted pregnancies.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	So you say that you're not one who push their belief on others and that you're "educative".
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	Then you should stop calling for a ban on abortion.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	You say you do a lot of research and self-educating on the topic, how come you think banning something will make it go away?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	160	If you continue to argue with a belligerent disregard for logic, I will have no choice but think you an unworthy debater and disengage.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	You demand logic?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	Try demanding some sense out of yourself!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	Did you actually read the whole thing?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	My whole argument?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	Or did you just skip a few lines along the way through?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	My point overall was that this debate is biased and complex, and that no sound amount of "logic" is going to convince anyone.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	This topic demands what a person "thinks" and "feels," not how he pulls out a statistic or two and calls a problem an "effect.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	" The correct answer is that an abortion is both, and yet you fail to see how I have clearly solved the problem for both sides.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	Rape is illegal, and yet it still happens.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	Think about that.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	If you actually "pieced" my arguments together, you would actually notice that I am actually not calling for an immediate ban on abortions.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	With the right plan, an abortion will no longer be necessary, and will be naught but bad memories.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	I give you educational examples and you deny them without giving them a second thought.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	Wow, that shows a lot of character.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	Clearly you are the most biased debater on this site.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	"If you continue to argue with a belligerent disregard for logic, I will have no choice but to think you an unworthy debater and disengage.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	"Wow, you've shattered me, that makes me reconsider everything, knowing that in your vision I am some f#cking pro-creationist who only gives a damn about his own f#cking opinion!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	You know what?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	I'm done with this BS, I shouldn't have bothered replying to you.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	You clearly show little respect towards me based on my beliefs.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	Do I make you sick?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	Good, I hope it lasts for a long time.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	You know something, if it wasn't for your 4th paragraph, I would have thought that you could never learn.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	Regardless, you clearly are too biased to see my point, and that is why I am done trying to convince you.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	161	I'll do my usual and just present more speeches and win more awards, after all, people in the real world actually think my ideas are worthwhile.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	You do speeches?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	Who actually corrects your grammar for you?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	I can't believe I have the patience to wade through the grammatically incorrect sentences and illogical structures of your arguments.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	Half the time I'm not even sure you're on point, I mean I don't even know what you're arguing for any more.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	Are you against a ban on abortion or not?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	It's a clear topic.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	You may have all the hearts to be a great debater, but that's all you've got at the moment.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	If you believe that this topic demands the "thoughts" and "feelings" of people, not on statistics and logics, how then will you convince legislators to make laws for your cause?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	They only work on facts, logics, numbers.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	"Rape is illegal, and yet it still happens" is this an argument Against or For a ban on abortion?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	I DID consider your educational example, and I also gave it a thought, but don't ask me to give it a second thought.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	I already told you it's not an original idea to go around doing talks.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	It's been done since people know how to talk.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	It's been done to death!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	If you're got a "right plan" to make abortions "no longer be necessary", then let's hear it, but you'll need to be more imaginative then doing talks.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	Good luck with that.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	162	I hope you win many awards :) But if you're fighting for a ban on abortion, don't expect us to be your friend, least of all, me.
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	163	A man has several billions of sperm, each potentially capable of creating human life.
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	163	A man does not create several billions of children in his lifetime, and he does not lose all sperm during sleep, within the body or when he masturbates.
SMCdeBater	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	163	Think about that, then don't reply, you will get the same answer should you decide to.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	164	You haven't made any new points with this at all!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	164	If there's any points in here at all it's "because it's numerous, it's not as important"!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	164	That's just bs.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	164	BS to the MAX.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	165	Close, but no.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	165	Men could potentially create numerous babies at a time.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	165	Women can only have one egg fertilizing at a time, with an approximate 9 month waiting period until childbirth.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	165	Think about those figures: Numerous conceptions - 9 Month waiting period with only one egg at a time.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	165	It isn't a case of 'that isn't as important,' as you assumed, it is a case of 'this can happen much faster than that can!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	166	"much faster.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	166	" so we're talking about speed?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	166	I don't get how this is at all relevant.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	166	You've lost me I'm afraid.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	167	Good, you're not important anyway.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	167	People like you don't get this sort of thing.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	168	So you continue to argue without making a valid point for your side?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	168	I should report you.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	169	No, you just don't see my point, and that is why I don't bother anymore.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	170	Do you see your own point?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	170	Don't post on here any more.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	170	It's polluting the debate.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	170	You've haven't posted anything of original value here and you haven't even made a very good job of re-writing other's arguments either.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	171	Go ahead.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	171	I dare you.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	171	It isn't my problem that you cannot understand what I am saying.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	171	I know for a fact that others on here do, so whatever really.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	172	I have in fact reported you.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	172	I don't know how it works, but ideally they should ban you from this debate at the very least, if not the entire site.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	172	Whether it'll happen is up to how good admin for this site is. . .
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	173	Sure, kill 'em off one by one.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	173	Hey, I just noticed, that applies a hell of a lot to your arguments doesn't it?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	173	Seeing as you think I post BS, I reported you as well, as in each of my posts is actually something regarding the topic, yet right here you haven't mentioned anything.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	173	Abortions are wrong in my point of view.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	173	Done.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	174	Jeesh, why are all you pro-lifers on this debate so incredibly dense?
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	174	You completely missed the point of my billions of sperm argument.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	174	I was shooting down a specific argument in the pro-holier-than-now-I-refuse-to-mind-my-own-business  arsenal.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	174	And that is the dramatically flawedpotentiallife argument.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	174	The only argument pro-life has is that the cluster of cells is alive.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	174	Okay fine, I'm through arguing that.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	174	You guys think you know more than science so obviously I'm not going to convince you otherwise.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	174	What Icanargue though is thatifthe tragedy here is thepotentiallife lost.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	174	Then it is logically irrefutable that lost sperm is just as tragic.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	174	Therefore, masturbation should be illegal, sex with your wife if she is barren should be illegal, sex if you're shooting blanks should be illegal, wet dreams should be illegal, etc. Regardless of the numbers involved, a potential life is still a potential life.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	174	So logically, if abortion is banned, so should (by pro-lifer logic even) all those things listed.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	174	There's no way for you to escape that.
iamdavidh	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	174	Not that your arguments have ever been bound by logic thus far.

SMCdeBater	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	180	I find the fact that there are instances where women think that it is right to abort the birth of a child is incredibly outrageous!
SMCdeBater	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	180	To think that people would rather cut of life in its entirety than to take wiser options, such as setting their child up for an adoption, or even personally entrusting the baby to someone close to them.
SMCdeBater	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	180	If I could 'personally' define the word 'abortion,' then it would be as follows:'ABORTION: The term refers to the irrational decision to KILL the child before it has been birthed from the womb'I am not going to sugar-coat abortions, because it's true, they are nothing short of murder!
SMCdeBater	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	180	'The children are killed before they can even process the thought' is one term that I have seen a few times in this debate (of course they have been worded differently, but again, I am not here to sugar-coat this sort of thing), and I can say that the mother/father has STOLEN the right and privilege of thought from these children by killing them.
SMCdeBater	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	180	They have also denied them of love, care, protection and most of all, they have denied them of a life.
SMCdeBater	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	180	As I have stated previously, I cannot even begin to understand why so many pregnant women do not consider putting the child up for an adoption rather than simply cutting the child off completely!
SMCdeBater	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	180	Surely the majority of you all would agree with me that a child has its rights even if it cannot understand them!
SMCdeBater	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	180	But the second that an abortion begins, you have stripped that child of it's rights, and there is no way that you can ever make amends.
SMCdeBater	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	180	And no, I am not trying to send anyone on a guilt-trip, but I would be glad to know that some of you have come to realize what exactly an abortion does, and not just to think of the process as "stabbing someone in the vagina.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	181	Before it's able to survive outside of the woman's womb, it's only a potential life, not an actual life.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	181	Society cannot keep it alive so society should not interfere.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	181	As a potential, it is in the same class as a single egg or sperm.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	181	Of course, once birthed the child still has no guarantee of life due to SIDS, diseases, etc. . .  but at least it has a better chance of survival.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	181	So, before the period of 20 weeks, it has no chance of survival outside of the womb, so the woman should have the choice of keeping it or not.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	182	Well, if you read my argument towards iamdavidh's argument on potential life in regard to sperm cells, you will understand that there are major differences to what is potential and what is actually fertilizing as we type.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	182	The fact that women consider an abortion as the first choice (or for that matter any choice) is too weak for some people, this includes me. What individuals fail to see, and admit, is that there is always another option, whether it be putting the child up for adoption or to leave the child in the care of a friend or family member, so that the child has a life and it is still able to give a couple what they actually want.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	182	People are so financial these days that they forget about human rights, something that a child deserves.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	182	We can all look at what science determines is a child and what isn't, but it is but some of us, who actually believe and support human life, will look as a fetus as a child, regardless of its understanding and capabilities.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	182	If someone isn't fit or capable of having a child, have safe sex, or if it is too late, give the child to someone who is.  Everybody wins.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	183	Until the fetus can actually survive outside the womb, it's a potential.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	183	Fertilization doesn't all of a sudden make an egg or a sperm instantaneous life.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	183	A lot of things must be perfect for the embryo to make it all the way to the end.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	183	If people drink too much alcohol it might kill the embryo, there's a host of other things that can affect its survival, shall we outlaw them all?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	183	I fully support giving people choice when it comes to other options.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	183	What I don't support is making it compulsory.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	183	Plain and simple.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	184	As I have already mentioned, several times, other choices are avaliable, and yet, many couples/individuals choose to ignore these choices.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	184	What I suggest is that protective sex must come into play, this way, we can completely forget about the possibility of an abortion.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	184	The only exception that I could possibly see to this is with the case of rape, and this is only covers 1% of all abortions.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	184	If abortions are outlawed, the world may finally smarten up when it comes to sex and childbirth, and then, just maybe, we can start worrying more about the future of the child rather than the beginning.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	185	This argument has already been covered, so I don't know why you're repeating it.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	185	But since you have, i will reply again:Protective sex is the act of preventing life from happening in the first place.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	185	You're preventing fertilization from happening, some view this as on the same level as abortion so since abstinence or condoms are not outlawed, neither should abortion.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	185	I get you're trying to make people realize the consequences of having unprotected sex, so what you should argue for is that UNPROTECTED SEX SHOULD BE BANNED, not abortion should be banned!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	185	Abortion is dealing with the aftermath, so let it be dealt with!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	185	If you want to PREVENT, then outlaw UNPROTECTED SEX.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	185	Make it illegal!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	185	Just like riding a bike without a helmet!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	185	It's illegal to ride bikes without helmets (at least in some countries).
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	186	This is what I derive from your argument:"We should not outlaw abortion, we should outlaw unprotected sex.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	186	This is because we want to prevent children from coming into this Earth, or kill them off should accidents happen.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	186	"This system is complete and utter BS, and would do more harm than good.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	186	If we wanted to prevent children from being born, we should educate, and provide more condoms and help encourage abstinence among teenagers and couples.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	186	This way, we can eventually move past outlawing unprotected sex and stop abortions for good.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	186	What you suggest does nothing to promote any form of childbirth.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	186	It doesn't give a single solution that doesn't cause more problems.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	187	You don't think making unprotected sex illegal is a workable option?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	187	Just compare it with many other things that are illegal: riding a bike without helmet, not wearing a seatbelt in a car.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	187	Most of the time, the cops don't know if you're wearing your seatbelt or not!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	187	But they certainly would know if you crashed your car!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	187	So if unprotected sex is made illegal (outside of a committed relationship) people can risk it if they want, but if the girl is pregnant and you seek abortion, then the authorities would know about it!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	187	Then you'd be fined lots of money, or the fine should be built into the cost of an abortion!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	187	That should be a deterent, wouldn't you say?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	187	Eventually people will learn that it's not good to have unprotected sex, they won't have to be told any more.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	187	Like wearing a seatbelt in a car, it's become second nature to people now.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	187	"Promoting childbirth"?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	187	I'm sorry but this sounds like you're trying to increase the world's population?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	187	That's just dictatorship, pure and simple.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	187	You want more people, so you force people to give birth?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	187	Go live in a country run by a dictatorship, that's should suit you perfectly.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	"You don't think making unprotected sex illegal is a workable option?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	"That's exactly what I think!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	Riding a bike without a helmet is not a good comparison when comparing it to sex.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	Sure, it shows that the consequences could be fatal, but with the case of pregnancy, one life is certainly at risk, and that could easily become two.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	this sounds like you're trying to increase the world's population?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	"Again, you are making assumptions, and they are wrong.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	I am all for childbirth, it keeps the system moving.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	I am against overpopulation.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	I suggest that rather than kill of a mistake, we educate to prevent the mistake from occurring.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	Overpopulation is way off the point; my point is that childbirth keeps the population where it should be!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	but if the girl is pregnant and you seek abortion, then the authorities would know about it!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	"Then it is too late.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	You have just admitted something that I have stated in a previous argument:"unprotected sex will become the next underground drug.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	"And guess what else?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	Then you see STD's creep back into the problem, in fact, potentially much worse than it was before!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	And sure, perhapssomepeople will learn, but notall.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	You need to admit that banning unprotected sex is a failing system with too many flaws to test.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	188	We need to educate productively if we are going to get anywhere with this problem!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	189	Ok, if outlawing unprotected sex makes it go underground like the drug scene, you don't think the same will happen to abortion if you outlaw that?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	189	So many people have brought up the point that outlawing abortion doesn't make it go away, it simply makes the practice unsafe and much riskier.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	189	You're contradicting your own points, so just leave it and relax your views a little bit.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	189	You also agree that we should educate to prevent mistakes from occuring.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	189	That's already happening so we're not arguing about that.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	189	You say it's too late to find out about an illegal activity after the consequences?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	189	How else can you find out about an illegal activity?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	189	Something must happen to bring it to the authorities' attention, duh!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	189	How does anyone know if you're wearing your seatbelt when you drive?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	189	They don't!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	189	But if you have an accident, it becomes apparent, then the law applies!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	189	Is it too late?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	189	May be it's too late for the driver, but does it serve to educate?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	189	YES!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	190	Ok, let's pull out 1,000,000 aborted fetuses and show people what each one looks like.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	190	Yeah, that educates, totally.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	190	Look, just read my other point, it's a bit too large to miss.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	191	Pull out aborted fetuses and show people?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	191	That's what you think an abortion is?  My opinion of your mental power/state has just dropped to a new low.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	192	Clearly you are too much of an idiot to understand sarcasm when you see it.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	192	Biased and contradicting at every corner,youpeople makemesick!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	193	Oh!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	193	You were being sarcastic!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	193	Hahahahaha!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	193	You actually didn't mean for people to pull out fetuses and wave it in front of people's faces while yelling "Check this out!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	193	Wow, I actually thought you meant that seriously.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	193	Boy, was I wrong!
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	194	Most abortions occur at 10 weeks, can somebody please look at these pictures and please tell me what that is if it's not human.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	194	And if you dare go watch the videosilent screamand please tell me what is going on there, because they sure aren't removing a clump of cells.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	194	If your are for abortion please tell me what that is they are sucking out into the trash.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	194	I don't think most people know what an abortion is, nor have they seen one.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	194	If you are for abortion at least inform yourself and watch the videosilent screamand make an educated call about abortion
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	195	You're so closed minded it's ridiculous.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	195	In fact, quite a few people have experienced abortion first hand, and it's never an easy decision, but sometimes it is the right one.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	195	It doesn't matter what the thinglookslike.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	195	Science tells us that thing isnotyet a sentient being, therefore itis notkilling a sentient being.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	195	Cute pictures does not = sound scientific reasoning.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	195	You don't like abortion.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	195	Fine, don't have one, but that youchoosenot to believe thefactthat at ten weeks that little thing has 0 sense of self, does not constitute any type of proof that abortion should be banned for those who choose to undergo itbeforethat thingissentient.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	195	No one is for abortion once the child is self-aware.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	195	A self-aware human should not be aborted.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	195	That isnota self-aware human, no matter how cute.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	195	And that said, the vast vast majority of abortions take place before the first couple weeks.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	195	And that said, mostsciencesays there is not even ahintofpossibleself-awareness until around 26 weeks!
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	I guess you were not man enough to match the videoSilent Screambecause that video clearly show a fetus doing what you say it can't; showing signs of awareness.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	I also I didn't say"few people have experienced abortion first hand".
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	What I said is that few really know what it is. About being "closed minded "it doesn't matter what the thing looks like.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	"If it looks human and genetically it's human; it probably is human.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	The question still remains unanswered: What kind of being is it?
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	Your attempt to redefine the question hasn't changed the question, nor does it answer it.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	And a question not properly answered doesn't go away.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	That's why abortion is still a hot topic 35yrs after Roe vs Wade.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	There are a lot of people for whom something seems dreadfully wrong and for those of you who support abortion to dismiss us with some fancy mental gymnastics is simply inadequate.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	So please, answer the question.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	You also lose credibility with statements like these"the vast vast majority of abortions take place before the first couple weeks.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	" How do you abort something you don't know you have?
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	In most cases it's a missed period that tips the woman off and that takes time.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	Facts are annoying things when they contradict you and you can't make them go away by changing them.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	Do your research first before you make assertions like this, Because for those of us who have.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	you lose credibility.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	But I think you make my point that most people don't know much about abortion.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	But tell me iamdavidh, were you ever an unborn baby?
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	Because if you were.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	you have to acknowledge that an abortion would have killed you, not something else but you.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	196	And that means abortion kills people in the early stages of their life not something else that later becomes them, but them.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	197	Listen, you want to believe it's a living thing based on that video, fine, I'll trust science.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	197	If science says it's a sentient being, I'll be against it.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	197	In the meantime, don't make these poor girls feel worse they they already do about the whole thing.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	197	So you're against it, but obviously a lot of people think that "silent scream" is rubbish.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	197	You know what, beatles make a noise when you squish them.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	197	They're not sentient though, and they actually have more brains than a fetus before the first couple weeks.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	197	Meanwhile, these poor girls, half the time they were raped, or their still just kids them self,and you get these nuts calling them nazis and killers and everything else,you know what, they're not killers.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	197	I don't know what a fetus is, you don't, but science does, and science says they aren't people yet.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	197	It says they're people after the third-trimester,before then, leave these girls alone until you have some scientific proof beyond,"I really really really reallyfeelit's a living person.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	197	"And to the last ridiculous paragraph.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	197	Had I been aborted I would have never existed, and so no, I would not have been killed.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	197	So there.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	197	I was a sperm once too, should guys stop ejaculating?
kamranw	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	198	Science has been wrong in the past.
kamranw	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	198	If science were always blindly trusted, we would never progress.
kamranw	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	198	It is challenging science that makes us find new and better answers.
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	199	I'm all for challenging science, but while we're at it why don't we challenge religions too?
kamranw	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	200	Sure why not?
kamranw	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	200	You can challenge any religion you like but what makes you think I am against abortion based on my religion?
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	201	You should spend more time thinking about what you say before you type because you are starting to appear irrational.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	202	science is irrational.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	202	and pretending you hear the screams of things that haven't developed vocal cords is perfectly sanegot it, thanks for the heads up :/These downvotes don't impress me either.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	202	I realize there is a religious coupe going on on create debate right now.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	202	But you'll get bored of being wrong eventually and move along to a site that will reinforce your misguided opinions instead of challenging them.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	202	Don't worry about saying good-bye, I hate long good byes and I tear up, you know, the emotion and all.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	203	You are good at making my point thank you.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	203	A question not properly answered never goes away, and equivocating on terms is a poor attempt to cloud the issue.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	203	It does appear you are rather uninformed about fetal development.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	203	I do hope you would be more open minded and consider the possibility that you might actually be mistaken.
jstantall	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	203	I only down vote faulty logic :) and insult is no argument, please deal with ihe issue at hand and actually respond to what is said and not what you think is said.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	204	What amazes me is that iamdavidh has the patience to put forth logics to argue against your stupid feelings and belief system.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	204	The question is never whether the fetus is a human!
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	204	We all know it's human!
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	204	It's a human sperm and egg so ofcourse it's human.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	204	The question really is "is it a person?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	204	and it's clearly not.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	204	Leave your beliefs and bible at home please.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	205	Iamdavidh is perfectly logical and rational.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	205	Jstantall, you're the one that's irrational.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	205	Can't you see?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	205	Oh, wait that's like asking a crazy guy if he can see that he's crazy!
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	206	You are wrong about science saying it is not a human being.
helloim123	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	206	SCIENCE SAYS IT IS A HUMAN BEING.

NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	207	Why do we need an excuse to get rid of a fetus if we don't want it?
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	207	It's our fetus, not yours, we can get rid of this one and then we can make another one!

trump	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	210	how is stabbing a pregnant dog, the same as abortion.
trump	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	210	it is completely different.
trump	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	210	we're not saying u can stab a pregnant person but we're saying that the pregnant person should have the option to abort.
trump	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	210	not that it is ok to go and stab any person that is pregnant.
iamdavidh	trump	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	211	Read what I was replying to.
iamdavidh	trump	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	211	I was being facetious.
iamdavidh	trump	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	211	Following the logic of the statement I was replying to, it would wrong to have an abortion ever under any circumstance, but something like say, stabbing a pregnant dog in the vagina, would be just fine.
iamdavidh	trump	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	211	if one were to follow the logic,which it's become quite apparent few posting under this topic are capable of.
iamdavidh	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	212	Ugh!
iamdavidh	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	212	lmao!
iamdavidh	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	212	Apparently I won this little debate because the entire thread that lead to my (again) having to over explained simple logic to the pro-lifers was deleted.
iamdavidh	iamdavidh	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	212	I guess the one I was arguing with had a sudden epiphany and saw how ridiculous I was making them look so decided to delete all their replies :)
atypican	trump	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	213	we're saying that the pregnant person should have the option to abort.
atypican	trump	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	213	Then why is your argument tagged "abortion should be banned"?
atypican	trump	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	213	Also funny to note is that (at this time) your post is the top post on this side!
atypican	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	214	No answer to my retort, just a down vote.
atypican	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	214	That helps alot!
SMCdeBater	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	215	I'm sooo sick of people like you who feel like they have to be contradicted to know that they're getting the point accross.
SMCdeBater	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	215	It is ridiculous and is getting on my nerves.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	216	I've lost everybody in this thread.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	216	can we just say that:- stabbing a dog anywhere is kinda sick and is not ok (unless you eat dogs like in some countries).
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	216	- abortion should not be outlawed until week 20 into the pregnancy.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	216	- people who are pro-life should keep their point of view and not force it on others and make them feel like they're murders, cos it's not like killing a person.
pujolspals	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	217	Abortion is stupid.
pujolspals	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	217	All thes chicks that have abortions are stupid.
NVYN	pujolspals	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	218	Are you arguing against abortion or against your intelligence?
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	219	This is not an argument but supporting evidence of why abortion should be banned.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	219	This woman knows first hand what abortion is and what it does.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	219	If you are going to argue for abortion you will need to overcome this woman's testimony.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	219	But I bet most people will just attack her character falsely.
jstantall	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	220	If you down voted this it says more about you than it does my point, shame on you.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	221	I once saw a fetus move towards the abortion probe, as if it wanted to be aborted as quickly as it could.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	222	Let's assume that we don't know when life begins or at what point those cells in the mothers womb become human.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	222	And let's say we can't answer the question, what is it.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	222	If we take all the arguments for abortion and weigh all the objections then I have only one question.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	222	If we don't know the right or wrong answer to the question of abortion.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	222	Why not err on the side of life?
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	222	If we don't know, and this debate demonstrates that, then why not use caution and restraint?

jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	222	What if we are wrong and it turns out that we have actually snuffed out the life of over 45 million children?
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	222	I think the guilt of that would have a more profound affect on our nation than thousands of women who die from back ally abortions.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	222	See, in abortion we as a nation are complicate in the act because we as a nation sanctioned it.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	222	In the back ally abortion we have no guilt because the parties acted contrary to our law.

jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	224	Whether it's right or not to take the life of any living being depends entirely upon the answer to one question: What kind of being is it?

jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	224	Let me put the issue plainly.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	224	If the unborn is not a human person, no justification for abortion is necessary.
jstantall	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	224	However, if the unborn is a human person, no justification for abortion is adequate.

jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	226	Let's say your kid comes to you and says "Daddy, can I kill it" I would bet money that how you answer that question depends entirely on what "it" is.

NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	227	You've simply been reiterating the same "it's a person, don't kill it" argument.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	227	Not good enough as it's been rebutted many times.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	228	You haven't brought any new arguments to the debate.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	228	You've simply been using one analogy after another.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	228	This is tiresome.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	229	This is not a new argument.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	229	You're repeating yourself with the same analogy for "it's a person, don't kill it" And your argument has been rebutted many times.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	229	The fetus before it can survive outside of the mother's womb is not a person.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	229	It's a potential life and it's parasitic in its relationship with its mother, the host.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	230	Many abortion doctors admit that this baby is a living human being.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	230	Many baptize the babies after the abortion is finished.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	231	Many?
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	231	How many?
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	231	Many think that it's the mother's choice if she wants to keep it inside her or not.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	231	Think of a mass rape by soldiers to try and stamp out a certain race of people in a village.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	231	I'd get rid of the seeds of hate the minute I can!
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	232	It not whether it's human.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	232	We know it's human.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	232	We also know that before at least week 20, it cannot survive on its own.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	232	It has all the POTENTIAL of a life, but that's only a POTENTIAL.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	232	Until it can be kept alive by society without the mother, it's the mother's choice to continue to bring this POTENTIAL life into existence or not.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	232	So the question is "Is it life, or is it potential life?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	232	" and the answer is "it's potential life".
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	232	So then it's in the same category as any egg or sperm on its own.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	233	Well, the question is what makes us a person, and what makes us special above those beings which are okay to kill (most animals, insects plants etc. . . ).
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	233	I would argue that it's our ability to think and feel at a higher level.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	233	An embryo cannot think, feel, see, hear, remember, or do any of the other things that distinguish us as people and therefore must be put into a separate category then a fully formed person.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	233	Considering your ignorance on the topic of biology that you demonstrated in the evolution debate, I would not be surprised if you were unaware of this, but if you don't believe me I would be happy to provide evidence (or you could save me the trouble and trust me).
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	233	The question then becomes: at what point does the unborn embryo/fetus gain the rights of a full grown person?
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	233	There are two extremes:1) The moment after conception.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	233	2) The moment of birth.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	233	My problem with number one is that a single celled organism shouldn't have rights that are equal to those of a person, and my problem with number two is that mere physical location (outside rather than inside the womb) shouldn't dictate whether we have rights, so I propose that the embryo/fetus gains rights over time as it develops.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	233	How early these rights are given is obviously something that is going to be debated, and, in my own opinion, should be debated because it will be a much more fruitful debate than the current "all or nothing" one that is all too common.
helloim123	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	234	By the end of the 1st trimester a baby can think, see, hear, remember, and many other things.
helloim123	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	234	What is the difference between killing a baby nine weeks after conception and murdering baby nine weeks after birth?
helloim123	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	234	Tell me!  I want to know.
helloim123	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	234	An abortion doctor failed to abort a baby and he was born alive.
helloim123	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	234	So the doctor took the baby and killed him.
helloim123	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	234	The doctor was not charged with murder but was charged with the failure to abort the baby.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	235	The difference is you're stopping the development of a fetus, which is not yet a life on its own.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	235	Killing a baby is taking an independent life.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	235	The fetus is a parasitic organism until it can survive outside of the mother's womb.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	235	This is around 20 weeks.
NVYN	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	236	I fully support this view.
NVYN	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	236	In my personal opinion, once the fetus can survive outside of the mother's womb (which means society can theoretically take care of the baby without the mother's input) then society can intervene.
NVYN	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	236	It should then be allowed to fully develop into an independent life.
NVYN	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	236	This stage is around 20 weeks of fetal development.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	The question isn't about person hood, The question is what kind of life is it?
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	By your logic it is OK to kill another human, especially if they are smaller and less developed than you , if they can't think, feel, see, hear, or remember than by all means, kill em.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	What you have just done is discriminated against a whole class of humans that are inferior to you and deemed them unworthy of life by your arbitrary standard.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	That sounds just like the logic of the Third Reich to me.  And that's exactly how they categorized it; the life unworthy of life.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	But let me ask you; were you ever an unborn child?
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	If you ever were the unborn child your mother carried, then you have to accept an undeniable truth: killing that child through abortion would have killed you.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	Not a potential you.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	Not a possible you.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	Not a future you.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	Abortion would have killed you.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	Aren't you glad your mother didn't view you in the same crass way you view other humans in the early stages of development.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	You are in essence arguing for a right that could have taken that very right from you.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	And just for the record, most abortions are performed at about 10 weeks.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	I've included a link so you can see what those embryos look like at 10 weeks.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	And please tell me what that is if it isn't human.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	Also in regards the fetus's (it's a fetus at 10 weeks) ability to think, feel, see, hear and remember watch the video "Silent Scream" to get a sense of just what it is you are arguing for.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	What you'll see is a fetus (just like you once were) recoil in fear has they fight for their life.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	237	But I do warn you, the footage is extremely graphic.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	238	If it can't think, feel, see, hear, or remember; can't survive without complete and total dependence on the biology of another being; and doesn't look particularly like people -- what exactly is it that makes this a "human"?
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	239	Well first off it's pretty obvious what makes it human, genetics.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	239	About thinking, feeling,seeing and hearing go watch the video"Silent Scream" and tell me what that baby is doing.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	240	I've seen "Silent Scream" four times already; I was convent-schooled and thus unsurprisingly I've been shown lots of graphically disgusting abortion pictures.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	240	And y'know what?
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	240	I'm still not remotely persuaded that it is preferable to ruin women's lives or leave them to die in back alleys.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	240	DNA?
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	240	Your sperm has DNA.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	240	Your hair and skin cells have DNA.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	240	Your saliva has DNA.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	240	Are sperm, hair, skin, and spit also human beings in their own rights?
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	240	About "thinking, feeling, seeing and hearing" -- you conceded that an fetus slated for abortion is not capable of doing these things in your post above.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	240	"By your logic .  .  .  if they can't think, feel, see, hear, or remember than by all means, kill em.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	240	"So this new argument that "Silent Scream" contradicts your earlier premise that the fetus does NOT "think, feel, see, or hear" is simply logically inconsistent.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	241	Ok, so it's better to kill 1500 children a day than a handful of women periodicallyDNA proves humanity, that's allUm whoops, you took that out of context.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	241	Go back and read what I said.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	241	Notice how that quote starts.

Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	242	But you posited the "can't think, see, feel, etc. " You supplied that and you endorsed it by posting it.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	242	Notice how you did that.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	242	Can't get out by saying that your characterization was part of a criticism - it was stillyourcharacterization.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	242	A clump of cells in utero is not a "child.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	242	" That's why medical science has words like "zygote" and "blastula" and "embryo" and "fetus.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	242	"If you are asking for my personal opinion on abortion, which you seem to be, it is that abortion is a highly imperfect solution to a very real problem; but that until we have developed and agreed as a society to disseminate a completely 100% effective, safe, and pragmatic method of birth control complete with age-appropriate sex education AND eliminated rape and abuse or coercion of children, then the societal costs of limiting abortion access much further than it already is (and it IS limited; states can regulate it after the first trimester and can ban it completely once the fetus reaches viability, and can also determine which procedures will and will not be permitted) are simply too great.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	242	Rather than banning it, we need to be working towards making abortion pretty much unneccesary.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	242	This is much harder to do than simply banning it, but does have the advantage of actually solving the problems posed both by allowing and by prohibiting abortion rather than just ignoring them.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	Tell me how my characterization of your view becomes my view.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	I don't see how the two things logical follow each other.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	A characterization of view, I always thought, was different from the adoption of the view.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	Maybe I'm wrong.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	So please tell me how that works.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	A clump of cells in utero is not a "child.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	" That's why medical science has words like "zygote" and "blastula" and "embryo" and "fetus.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	"zygote,blastula,embryo and fetus are terms used to describe the stages in the development of the child.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	They are not ontological terms.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	So you are right, the stages of development are not the child.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	They are the stages in the development of the child.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	But I don't see were that gets us.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	abortion is a highly imperfect solution to a very real problemSo what I hear you saying is that life is a problem and death is preferable to life.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	So why do you take the side of death and not life?
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	If the question of abortion is so "debatable" why not err on the side of life?
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	It would seem wise to use caution and restraint regarding abortion.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	And the unrestrained permission of it would be folly.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	Now, about the 100% effective and safe solution.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	It's called abstinence.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	Yes, I know all the objections to it, but the evidence tells another story.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	Abstinence has been shown to be vastly superior to other types of sex-ed.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	But don't take my word for it, read the report that just came out.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	On making abortion pretty much unnecessary.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	Consider that married couples don't have abortions.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	Take a look sometime time at the demographics of who gets abortions.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	About banning abortion and it's effectiveness on reducing the number of abortions.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	Check the data.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	the rate of abortion went through the roof after Roe vs WadeBut really this is not about abortion or sex-ed.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	It's about trying promote polyamory.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	Sex-ed is how it's promoted and abortion is how you mitigate the effects of it.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	It's known as insanity when you do something over and over and expect different results.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	If polyamory keeps producing such horrible results what makes us think that if we keep practicing it that we will get different results?
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	243	If you use something and it breaks in the process, like using your cell phone as hammer, something ought to tell you that it wasn't being used properly for the purpose for which it was designed.
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	244	I don’t care to debate nor discuss your convoluted justifications for destroying a human fetus or embryo.
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	244	My question to you: Why did your mother not destroy you while you were nothing but a cellular glob?
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	244	Answer: Because your mother, and probably your father, loved you more than they loved themselves!
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	244	Hypocrite!
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	244	You are ready to justify the killing of human fetuses, while at the same time ignorant of the fact that ‘your’ bullshit argument is possible by reason of your mother’s refusal to kill you while your were nothing but a cellular glob!
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	244	A female like you who is willing to justify the most cowardice of crimes against her own would-be progeny will commit any manner of crime against her own offspring.
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	244	So, I think you should make certain that no cellular glob that is human in nature should ever be allowed to grow within your womb, for any child that is born of your matrix will most likely be sacrificed for your own selfish benefit.
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	244	This is no argument!
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	244	Why, because, you have confessed to the innocence of killing your own would-be progeny.
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	244	Down-vote all of my arguments!
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	244	It still will not change the fact of your willingness to advocate not only the killing of all human fetuses (yes, all human fetuses), but the killing of your own would-be children.
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	244	Go ahead!
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	244	Justify yourself, for your response is nothing more than a self-justification via the state agreeing with you that should kill your un-born progeny.
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	244	Oh, I can say much more about females such as you.
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	244	Please, provoke me! BTW, how many children have you given birth to?

lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	247	Correcting criminals like yourself that think a debate justifies your criminal intention!
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	247	Silly criminal, debates are for just persons with just intentions, not criminals with crime in the seared conscience!
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	247	STFU?
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	247	Create Debate is not a forum for justifying the unjustifiable.
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	247	Create Debate is a debating format for rational thought.
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	247	Killing an un-born fetus cannot be rationalized!
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	247	So, why do you stretch the intention of debate?
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	247	I know!
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	247	You are justifying your intent!
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	247	Justifying the undebatable with debate!
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	247	You are still a criminal!
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	248	Typical.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	248	You didn't come for a debate, you came for a fight.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	248	Debates are for people interested in listening to both sides and expecting to get out of it with a better understanding of the world.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	248	You came to "correct" people, not to understand other points of view.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	248	The undebatable?
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	248	There's no such thing.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	248	Every issue is debatable.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	248	It's true that some have stronger arguments on one side than the other, but this shouldn't bother the rational person you claim to be.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	249	I’m not defending myself nor my viewpoint, I am boldly declaring the implications of the pro-abortionist.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	249	You must understand that if I am truly anti-abortionist, I will not waste time dancing and playing with individuals who promote the killing of human fetuses.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	249	I did not come for a fight as you have claimed, what I came for was an intellectual abortion of anti-fetus rhetoric.

lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	249	Would you care to debate or find someone to debate that proposition?
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	249	Again, No man is a woman.

chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	250	As I said, some debates have much stronger arguments to one side.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	250	1 is not 4.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	250	I agree.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	250	If both numbers refer to the same kind of thing, 1 is not 4.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	250	1 banana is not 4 bananas.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	250	One could argue that, if it's not specified, 1 could be 4.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	250	. .  For example, 1 family might have exactly 4 people in it.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	250	In this case, 1 (family) is 4 (people).
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	250	But if the numbers are just shown without "units", it's usually implied that they are probably referring to the same thing.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	250	Therefore, 1 is not 4.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	250	If you have your arguments in order, every issue is debatable.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	250	It's just that some are closer to a consensus than others.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	251	If both numbers refer to the same kind of thing, 1 is not 4.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	251	1 banana is not 4 bananas.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	251	One could argue that, if it's not specified, 1 could be 4.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	251	. .  For example, 1 family might have exactly 4 people in it.

lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	251	1 is not 4 is a proposition.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	251	The proposition is not an accounting statement.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	251	It is a proposition that asserts that 1 and 4 are not predicable of each other.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	251	In fact if that proposition is debatable then the law of mathematics is without a foundation.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	251	Your arguments fail to debate the proposition, 1 is not 4 , but yet argues distinctly different propositions.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	252	I think that referring to mathematical rules as "laws" is the kind of misleading argument religious people like to use when implying that when using mathematics you require faith.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	252	Mathematics are not the ultimate truth about anything, neither should they be treated as unchangeable laws of the universe.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	252	Mathematics, as well as physics, chemistry, etc.  are a set of tools invented by humans in order to explain phenomena we observe around us.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	252	We made sciences up, and it's up to us to upgrade them in order to improve our knowledge about the world.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	252	Here I didn't go as far as to point a flaw in mathematics or something that should be changed, I actually agreed that in most cases 1 is not 4, and I know how useful that is in our daily life.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	252	My point is, we can and should question and debate everything, even the foundations of something which has been working for us all along, because we can never know when old explanations might fail us.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	252	This is specially valid for the question of abortion, since our old conceptions about when life begins might be wrong.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	252	Anyways, if my semantic discussion of 1 not being 4 was not mathematical enough for you, here I got another one.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	252	"1 is not 4"Wrong, this is not always the case.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	252	When dealing with binary numbers, when 1 is in the third number from the right, as in 100, 1 represents 4.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	252	In 111, 100, 10100, and so on, the third 1 is always 4 (as in the decimal system).
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	253	I think you are misunderstanding what a logical proposition is.  True, we can pretend to debate everything by use of fallacious thoughts, but when an argument is illogical nothing is debated.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	253	However, in a sense we can irrationally argue everything!
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	253	Agreed!
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	253	You have claimed that “all issues are debatable” while at the same time failing to support your proposition.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	253	The fallacious arguments you have submitted fail to refute my proposition and consequently indicate that only my proposition, i. e.  not all issues are debatable, is axiomatic.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	253	There is not one axiom you have affirmed that is evidence of your assertion, “All issues are debatable”.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	253	The only logical and axiomatic proposition ofthis debateis simply: Some issues are debatable.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	254	So going back to abortion.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	254	you say that an illogical argument is not-debatable.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	254	So could you explain what is illogical about debating abortion?
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	254	Clearly, just by being here you dispute your own statement.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	254	It seems to me that you are just going around the issue without proving that killing a non-fully developed fetus is the same thing as killing a 3 year old child.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	254	Prove your statement without evading the debate and calling it "illogical".
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	254	- Or else prove why it is illogical to debate this.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	255	The principle of pro-abortion: Human fetuses and embryos are sacrificial.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	255	Welcome to a self-evident truth.

lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	255	The pro-abortionists could dispute the words of the principle, but in doing such the pro-abortionist must necessarily contradict the pro-abortionist view.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	255	2.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	255	The anti-abortionist has no reason to debate the principle because the truth of the principle is self evident.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	255	Don’t make the mistake of thinking that anti-abortionists will sacrifice their un-born offspring.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	255	And furthermore, you will not be mistaken if you think pro-abortionists will sacrifice their un-born progeny for themselves.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	255	Now, let’s see if you and I canlogically debate the principleI have affirmed of pro-abortionists.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	255	Seriously, let’s attempt a debate amongst one another as a test of my ability to reason.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	255	Good luck!
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	256	the truth of the principle is self evident.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	256	You mean that, in your opinion, the principle is false, right?
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	256	First, logically explain me why do you think this is absolutely false, as in, there's absolutely no situation in which this could be true, no matter which other factors are involved.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	256	Also, I'd like to say that I'm not sure about my opinion on abortion.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	256	I do think that interrupting a pregnancy is not good, but I cannot simply ignore the problems an undesired child might bring to its family and society.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	256	At this point in my life, I wouldn't consider abortion, but I don't feel like I can make this decision for other people, so I wouldn't like it to be "banned".
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	256	This matter puzzles me, so I don't usually join debates related to it.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	256	I just came into this one because I saw your comment about criminals and the undebatable, so now I'm here just looking forward to seeing you logically prove that there's absolutely no situation in which sacrificing a human embryo is the less of two evils.
chapulina	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	256	I'm looking forward to a debate.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	257	the truth of the principle is self evident.

lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	257	No, the principle of pro-abortion is: “Human fetuses and embryos are sacrificial.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	257	” The principle is true to fact; it is not false to fact.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	257	My assertion is indicating the ethical standard of pro-abortionists.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	257	I am not saying that their principle is good or just, I am affirming the principle of their agenda.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	257	Now, consider the principle of the anti-abortionist: Human fetuses and embryos are not sacrificial.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	257	Does this help?
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	257	Also, I'd like to say that I'm not sure about my opinion on abortion.

lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	257	I’ll reply to this part after we clearly understand one another about the truth of the principle of pro-abortion.
lawnman	chapulina	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	257	This is a fair approach.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	258	I couldn't help but notice what a load of bullst you're capable of dishing out.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	258	Firstly you're way off the topic of the debate.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	258	It's whether abortion should be banned!
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	258	Not whether human fetuses and embryos are sacrificial.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	258	If people want to get rid of their fetuses it's their choice (whether it's sacrificial or not).
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	258	I suggest you save some of that energy to debating the topic.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	258	So far, all i've heard in the hundreds of arguments against abortion is that "it's a person, don't commit murder".
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	258	which has been rebutted many times.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	258	So bring something original to the debate, don't dress up the same cr*p in different packaging.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	259	The debate police have arrived; they are armed with irrational commentary and laughable musings.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	260	I wish there was a debate police on this site.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	260	People like you should never be allowed to hijack debates with confusing ramblings and illogical emotions that are neither intelligible reasonings or on topic.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	261	"illogical emotions".
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	261	Obviously there are many emotions.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	261	Please list the emotions that are illogical.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	261	(BTW, your arguments are mostly ad hominem.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	261	And as far as I am concerned they don't evidence a willingness to debate a proposition; they merely attack the debater and fail to argue the evidence of your position and your accusations.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	261	)Yes, I will continue to dismiss your posts.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	261	(Unless of course you demonstrate sound argument.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	262	Here's another ad hominem argument for ya:What's wrong with ad hominem arguments against people like you?
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	262	(by "people like you" I mean all those who have nothing original to say other than the same soggy "it's a person, don't commit murder" and have a complete disregard for debating ethics, especially the scoring side of things: example?
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	262	100 arguments of the same point scores 100 for the side without actually being 100 arguments).
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	262	You can take that home and bank it with the rest of my other ad hominem arguments ;)
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	263	What's wrong with ad hominem arguments against people like you?
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	263	That question alone evidences a supreme form of ignorance concerning the art of refutation.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	263	Logicians refer to this ignorance as ignorantio elenchi.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	263	You mentioned “debating ethics”, but your arguments are void of the same.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	264	You haven't answered the question.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	264	but you do like latin, so here:Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	264	Duis eget tincidunt sapien.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	264	Proin sed magna non sem consequat sodales eu convallis dui.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	265	Oh I forgot, about emotions that are illogical?
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	265	There are many instances where an emotion can be illogical.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	265	Sometimes they're not illogical, so here's an instance where emotions are illogical: Your feelings of guilt and sympathy towards a fetus as if they're actual babies is illogical because they're simply not babies.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	265	I guess that's also an ad hominem argument since YOU feel it?
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	265	Am I attacking YOU then?
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	265	Bank it with the rest.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	266	Your feelings of guilt and sympathy towards a fetus as if they're actual babies is illogical because they're simply not babies.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	266	That is not an argument, it is an assertion you have yet to argue the truth or falsity thereof.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	266	Moreover, you have not demonstrated how or why emotions are capable of being logical or illogical.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	266	So, I am still awaiting a list of illogical emotions.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	266	(Have you heard the expression, “a fool’s errand”?
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	266	If not, you certainly will once you realize the terms ‘logical’ and ‘illogical’ are not predicable of emotions.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	266	)One more thought, you may want to take the time and research and learn what an ‘ad hominem’ is and is not.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	266	(I need not mention that your statement demonstrates the fallacy of petitio principii.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	266	You should research that as well.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	267	You're annoying me but I must say I find you a little bit amusing.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	267	Call itassertionor whatever you want, it explains why you shouldn't push for a law that will affect the lives of those who don't share your views.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	267	and feelings ;)Stay on track there horsie!
Banshee	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	268	Criminal?
Banshee	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	268	LOL, I was invited to intern with the prosecutor's office.
Banshee	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	268	And FYI, falsely alleging in print that someone is a criminal is called "libel" -- or if you want to be technical, "thetortof civil libel," meaning that I now have a cause of action to sue you if I like.
Banshee	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	268	(Ain't screenshots grand?
Banshee	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	268	) Congrats --youjust crossed the line between what is merely rude and childish, and what is actually forbidden by law!
Banshee	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	268	Please, by all means, go on making an ass of yourself.
Banshee	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	268	It's funny and it totally discredits your position so in effect I win twice .  .  . :Dlolololololol
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	269	#1 Our mutual anonymity precludes the possibility of personal injury by defamation.
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	269	No person’s identity has been defamed and hence you have no case!
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	269	#2 I find it quite humorous that you must associate yourself with some legal professional as though that would somehow imply your competence concerning legal concepts.
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	269	Please, by all means, go on making an ass of yourself.
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	269	It's funny and it totally discredits your position so in effect I win twice .  .  . You may think that you have won something, but at what cost?
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	269	Lastly, if I make (as you claim) an ass of myself it certainly was not for myself; for I am a man of substance and not image, and the substance I represent justifies every mother-to-be who has chosen to keep her baby.
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	269	You, on the other hand, are nothing but image, and hence your image is the result of winning or losing a debate about terminating the lives of unborn fetuses.
lawnman	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	269	Great Image no doubt!
SMCdeBater	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	270	lawnman, he has a point.
SMCdeBater	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	270	Wouldn't it be easier to just leave it?
SMCdeBater	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	270	The fact that you both have remained offtopic for 5 posts tells me that you both need to cool your jets, so can you both just agree to disagree?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	271	Agreeing to disagree means abortion should not be banned.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	272	Again, you feel the need to have the last say.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	272	Just drop it, agree to disagree, it really isn't up to us (i. e government choice at the end of the day).
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	273	Unlike you I don't JUST want to have the last say:Agreeing to disagree means abortions should not be banned.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	273	I'll explain what this means to you since you clearly have no idea.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	273	So the 2 sides disagree on whether abortions should be banned, which means each to its own: This essentially means pro-lifers can go on having children (regardless of whether they want them or not).
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	273	Pro-choicers can go on having abortions as an option.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	273	Each to its own!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	273	To make a law in any democratic society, the majority must agree, if you don't have a majority, then the law will not pass, so the status quo is abortions CANNOT BE MADE ILLEGAL.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	273	get it?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	273	Government's choice, you say?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	273	The government represent the people of a nation if you live in a democratic society.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	273	Where do you live?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	274	GET OVER IT!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	274	You downvote my arguments and now you won't rest until you HAVE the last say.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	274	You continuously ask me questions, even as I stated that I am done.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	274	Keep going and I will report you a third time.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	274	Solve abortions as best you can, I just hope you don't corrupt the system further.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	274	(Note: No need to reply)
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	275	If you kill a child, I'd kill you myself if I could.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	275	But we're not talking about children or babies here are we?
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	275	so don't try to change the definition of a fetus to suit your arguments because that definition is simply wrong.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	275	Don't try and force me to have children when I don't want to.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	275	They're fetuses.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	275	I make them and I can break them and make some more, it's a difficult decision when I have to abort them, but when I'm ready to have children I will have children, not when you think I'm ready.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	275	It makes no difference to your life, but it has a massive impact on mine so don't butt in!
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	275	Women who've had abortions have gone on to have children later on when they're ready.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	275	You claim to represent mothers who've chosen to keep their babies - good for you, but here's a news flash: they don't actually need you to represent them!
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	275	They don't need you to argue that they should be allowed to keep their babies, nobody's trying to stop them!
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	275	So it's a great position of risk that you've placed yourself in.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	275	A very challenging role!
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	275	I don't know how you do it!
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	276	Ah, judging by the inordinate amount of posts you have submitted on this question, I will rationally infer you are on a mission.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	276	It’s not everyday we come across an Abortion Missionary; consequently, I will completely disregard anything more you care to post at CD.
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	276	May your god bless you according to the abundance of riches you seek.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	277	Nice retort!
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	277	Very on topic, again.
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	277	If you feel the need to say something that's got nothing to do with the debate topic, I suggest you send me a private message?
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	277	That way, you're not affecting the scoring with your useless ramblings!
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	278	And your ad hominem arguments are "on topic"?
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	278	Here comes another red-herring argument under the cloak of pseudo-intelligent argument!
lawnman	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	278	What say you?
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	279	"What say you?
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	279	What century are you from?
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	279	Oh wait, you're trying to be French in an English kinda way?
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	279	hahahahahahaOk, was that ad hominem?
NVYN	lawnman	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	279	hahahaha
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	280	Partial-birth abortion.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	280	That is all I have to say and I get the chills.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	280	This abortion is usually performed in the third trimester.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	280	The baby is forced into the birth canal legs first and everything except the head is delivered.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	280	The doctor then stabs the head while it is still in the canal and sucks out the brains.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	280	I will say some very important facts:At nine weeks a baby has a heartbeat.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	280	At 4.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	280	5 months he can feel pain.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	280	This baby, this human being can feel the stab of the knife.
helloim123	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	280	He can feel himself dying.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	281	You haven't brought anything new to the debate at all.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	281	Still the "it's a person" argument.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	281	It's been rebutted many times.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	281	Many pro-choice people have agreed that in the third trimester abortions shouldn't be allowed unless it's absolutely necessary to save a life.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	281	If the fetus was going to experience a life of mainly vegetative state or the mother would certainly die, then I say save the mother cos she could at least have the chance to have another baby.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	282	Don't compare people to the Nazis.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	282	Nazis think they're superior to other races when in fact they are not.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	282	The fetus is not a person.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	282	And don't say it is because this has been argued too many times.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	282	I'm tired of see this argument: "Abortion would have killed YOU!
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	282	" No it wouldn't.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	282	It wasn't me because it was a fetus.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	282	My mother would have killed a fetus, not me!  My mother had an abortion before me, but I'm here now so how do you know if it wasn't me that she aborted initially?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	282	Are we going to take this debate into the realms of fantasies and reincarnations?
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	283	The question is not what makes us a person.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	283	The question is; what is it?
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	283	Genetics tells us that it is human, although in the early stages of development.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	283	An embryo cannot think, feel, see, hear, remember, or do any of the other things that distinguish us as peopleThis argument had some weight before the ultrasound.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	283	But in this day and age with 3D and 4D imagining it is simply naive.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	283	But let's say your right and we don't know at what point the unborn embryo/fetus gains the rights of a full grown person.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	283	Why not err on the side of life?
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	283	If we don't know it would seem wise to use caution and restraint.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	283	Therefore to allow abortion on demand would be the height of folly.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	283	So in conclusion; if we don't know when a fetus becomes a person we should ban abortion because it might take the life of a person.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	284	Allow me to explain: I do believe that at a certain point in the pregnancy, abortion should not be legal.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	284	Where this point is, is what we should be debating.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	284	Clearly a single cell cannot think, see, etc. . .  and therefore it is silly to consider this when an embreo has person status.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	284	Clearly you think that it should be illegal early in the pregnancy, but do you at least understand why it shouldn't be at conception?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	285	"The question is not what makes us a person.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	285	The question is; what is it?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	285	"This is how you debate?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	285	You simply change the question?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	285	So with that stupid tactic I can just say "the question is not what it is (because we're not debating the fact that it's human.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	285	It certainly is human alright.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	285	) The question is: is it a person?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	285	" If it is a person, why don't we give it a passport while we're at it?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	285	Register it for voting too.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	285	All fetuses should be represented in parliaments to truly be democratic.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	285	You people make me sick how you see things and then force your views on others.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	Yes I do, because I think clarity is more important than agreement and I'm trying to be precise in my thinking.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	I don't find ambiguity or equivocation very helpful in debates.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	I ask the question because it is an ontological question and we need to know what it is that we are taking the life of.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	Asking the question of personhood doesn't get us very far because it is a characteristic of the thing in question just like the word fetus is.  They tell us something about the thing but they don't tell us what the thing in question is.  To know that requires an ontological question and that's why I ask; what is it?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	And you are correct, it is human although in the early developmental stage known as fetus just like you are at the stage known as adulthood, assuming your past puberty and if not you are an adolescent and yet still fully human just like a fetus is.  And humans are the sort of things that have personhood; it's not what they are but a characteristic they posses.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	Now I think the question, what is it, is one you would ask instinctively.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	What do I mean.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	Assuming you have a child, what would you say to that child if it came up behind you and asked; can I kill it?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	I'd bet money that the first question of your lips would be; what is it?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	And if it was the fly that's been bugging you, you would say yes and if it was the kid down the street you would say no.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	You see your answer hinges on the question; what is it and no other question.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	I hope you can see that.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	And the reason you would say no to killing the kid down down the street is because you know, instinctively, that humans aren't the sort of thing you just kill flippantly, it requires proper justification.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	That's why I oppose abortion.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	Killing humans for the sake of convenience is unjustified and evil.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	BTW insult is not an argument, it's what you do when your position is unsound.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	You try and discredit your opponent to make yourself look good.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	But notice my character is unrelated to the question at hand, it has no bearing on it.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	That my friend is known as a genetic fallacy and an Ad hominem.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	286	You don't actually answer the question, you just obscure it and that's the opposite of clarity.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	Ad hominem?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	Nice one!
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	I gavelawnmana load of ad hominems a little while ago as well!
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	In my book, it's fully justified to discredit the character of the opposition if they prove themselves to be logically unsound and are showing obvious character weaknesses.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	By doing that, you're showing everyone that your opposition is incapable of making sound judgements.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	Now, I think I've read this story of the boy coming up to his father and asking "can I kill it?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	why?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	It's because you've written it already in a different post!
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	Recycling is acceptable when it comes to milk cartons, but i find it tedious here.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	Now I've already answered this but i'll gladly do it again: Killing a grown kid is murder!
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	Why did society make a law to try and stop murders?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	Because society benefits from having its productive members alive and contributing!
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	Now at the end of the day, morals and righteousness are all about survival of the species.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	Don't believe me?  Thou shall not kill.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	thou shall not steal.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	thou shall honour thy parents.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	etc. . .  all designed to foster a peaceful productive society with the end goal being survival of the human species.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	Now, a kid has made it all the way through the whole process of fetal development, which is not easy to do because miscarriage statistics are quite high.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	That kid has earned its right to be a part of society.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	Killing that kid is wrong.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	A fetus on the other hand, can be created very easily and can also be lost just as easily too.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	The point here however is that the human species is in no danger whatsoever of being extinct, so society hasn't seen fit to mandate saving every chance of adding to its membership.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	This is the way it should be.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	Maybe one day, we'll find ourselves in the position of an endangered species and guess what?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	I bet there'll be a law in every country that abortion is illegal!
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	That's why societies make law.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	287	If it has nothing to do with the survival of society, society should stay out of it.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	About Ad hominem, Let's say all the nasty things about me are true and much worse.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	What does that tell us about my claim?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	nothing.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	It only says something about me and is therefore irrelevant to the question at hand.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	So what if I'm logically unsound and have obvious character weaknesses?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	does that mean I'm therefore incapable of saying anything truthful?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	So to say because of this therefore that I think is a a non sequitur.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	And since recycling is a good thing I'll say it again.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	Insult is not an argument, it's a failure to provide one.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	Now your free to use them if you like but they don’t carry much weight with me; I really am much worse than you think.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	Now at the end of the day, morals and righteousness are all about survival of the species.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	If that is true, then you are mistaken when you saidKilling a grown kid is murderBecause that means at some point it would become a good thing to kill grown kids when it is necessary for the survival of the species or to foster a peaceful productive society.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	But who decides what is good for the species, how do you define good, good for who?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	But to my question "can I kill it" Your answer tells me that you instinctively know that there is something inherently wrong with murder and that it ought not be done.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	You recognize that there is something about murder that makes it wrong.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	And that wrongness is a characteristic of the act and not the peoples opinion of it.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	Gassing six million Jews was wrong even if the Germans thought it was good.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	You know that and so do I.  But if that is the case then your premise of morals and righteousness being about survival of the species would be false because the wrongness of the act proceeds our perception of it and is independent of us.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	It is objectively wrong.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	And further more how did it come to be that survival of the species was the good to be obtained?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	Because in your scheme it could have been otherwise.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	In your scheme it would appear to be that there really is no such thing as the good or the wrong.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	Because if your correct, like I’ve said, we could have just as well decided that killing grown kids is a good thing.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	But when we see kids butchered or any other injustice in the world something cries out within us that what we see is wrong.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	And we know it’s wrong because we know there is a good from which it deviates.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	And your definition of that good ( survival of the human species) is woefully inadequate to account for that kind of reaction.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	Because If you were to see someone gunned downed I seriously don't think you are saying to yourself; Hey, we as a society need that person you therefore shouldn't do that.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	No I think not, your gut reaction is; Whoa!
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	that's not right.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	what the.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	We don't make laws to make things wrong, we make laws because we know that somethings are inherently wrong, they are wrong in and of themselves, like murder, theft and disrespecting people; especially our elders.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	But what I think is more telling is the way you discriminate on the basis of level of development.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	Notice how you use the phrase “grown kid” So I ask you what’s the difference between a human in the womb and a human at the park?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	Level of development.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	The terms fetus and grown child describe the stages of development in the life of a human in this case.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	So when the life of a human is unjustly taken be it at 1 month after conception, 1 month after birth or 10 years of age it is wrong, that’s called moral clarity.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	That’s why the question “can I kill it” is so clarifying.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	It’s the last word, it, that makes all the difference.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	What is it, is an ontological question.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	I’m not asking the question, what’s its stage of development.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	That would be absurd to answer the question that way.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	You would never answer your kid that way.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	Hey daddy, can I kill it?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	Well son, how old is it, you know the younger the better.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	But that’s how you try and answer the question of abortion.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	I keep asking, what is it that we are killing?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	And you keep telling me how old it is, well it’s just at the fetus stage.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	OK, so what is it?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	And like I’ve said before; a question not properly answered doesn’t go away, it keeps getting asked.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	So I will keep asking the question, what is it?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	Till I get an adequate answer.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	But honestly you know as well as I do what it is and the only reason you would answer differently is if you were trying to justify something that you instinctively know to be wrong.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	Final thought on showing everyone that your opposition is incapable of making sound judgments.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	You said;the human species is in no danger whatsoever of being extinct, so society hasn't seen fit to mandate saving every chance of adding to its membership.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	This statement from you destroys your whole argument.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	If this is true, why are there still laws against murder?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	And why are there hospitals?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	Why did the President just pass a massive health care reform bill?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	if we are in no danger whatsoever of being extinct what are we so concerned about?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	If our survival is not in question then what is the basis for our actions?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	It can't be survival of the human species, were doing that quite well.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	So what then is it if it's not survival of the human species?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	288	Maybe somethings are actually objectively wrong, maybe human life is valuable and maybe we know it.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	Because that means at some point it would become a good thing to kill grown kids when it is necessary for the survival of the species or to foster a peaceful productive society.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	We have executions.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	We execute murderers.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	These are actually not kids but adults.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	So we do kill people and I fully support it.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	Gassing six million Jews was wrong even if the Germans thought it was goodWell, arbitrarily exterminating a race of people goes against human survival.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	If you were to see someone gunned downed I seriously don't think you are saying to yourself; Hey, we as a society need that person you therefore shouldn't do that.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	No I think not, your gut reaction is; Whoa!
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	that's not right.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	what the.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	You're absolutely right.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	But you fail to see that ourgut reactionis our subconsciousness and in its own language, it's saying "hey, survival of the species is at stake here!
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	Level of developmentYou're exceptionally thick, so I'm not hoping to get through to you at all.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	I'm simply hoping you'd one day wake up.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	How is a fetus not the same as person in the park?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	Well let's see.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	if the mother suffers a heavy fall or gets a bad virus, the fetus may well be naturally aborted and may no longer be, hell, sometimes it simply takes a little bit of stress felt by the mother for the fetus to be aborted naturally.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	A person in the park however, takes a hell of a lot more to end.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	why are there still laws against murder?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	And why are there hospitals?

NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	Yes, human lives are valuable, but like I said, we're in no danger of extinction.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	All these measures such as laws against murder, hospitals, national health care, etc. . .  are preliminary steps.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	Laws to mandate the saving of every possible human fetus would probably be the last thing to do.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	289	This may be necessary if something all of a sudden killed 90% of humans on Earth, for example.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	290	Thank you for making my point so well, you are correct.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	290	Taking human life requires proper justification.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	290	However waving a magic wand and declaring a human life only potential life or something else is not proper justification.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	290	It's a unique human life and there is no way around that without ignoring the obvious.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	290	Declaring it to be something else and equivocating on terms may salve your conscience but it doesn't change the reality of what it is.  It's reality is not dependent on you, it's determined by what it actually is. If being thick and asleep keeps me from killing innocent humans in the early stages of development and makes me outraged at their slaughter than I'm guilty as charged and wear those names with honor
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	291	waving a magic wand and declaring a human life only potential life or something else is not proper justificationIt is proper justification for me and a lot of other people.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	291	Because with a potential life, we're not commiting murder.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	291	Like I said, we're stuck on the "potential" VS "definite" point.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	291	If being thick and asleep keeps me from killing innocent humans in the early stages of development and makes me outraged at their slaughter than I'm guilty as charged and wear those names with honorI hope you're a vegan as well.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	291	It would make sense, since eating meat would mean that you're ending lives.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	291	If you're a meat eater, you might say "oh it's not human, so it's ok" but others will say "how dare you discriminate towards other species".
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	291	but you should be ok living with them hassling you because you hassle others pretty much the same way.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	292	Saying something is proper justification doesn't make it so.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	292	You first have to prove that it is and that you haven't done.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	292	You've only dismissed it's humanity.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	292	.  If it is only a sperm or egg it is indeed alive but not fully human seeing it lacks the full chromosome set.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	292	But once it fertilizes and the chromosome set is complete; it's fully human.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	292	Either it's fully human and alive or it's not.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	292	I don't see any other option and the potential life argument doesn't factor in at all.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	292	Again we are talking about the proper justification of taking human life; rabbit trails don't interest me. About hassling; I will defend the innocent at my own expense; even if it cost my life because that's the right thing to do and it's always right to do what is right.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	293	Proof that aborting a fetus is proper justification of killingIt's potential life.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	293	There's nothing to prove.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	293	It doesn't have any rights.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	293	No doubt you'll disagree and all I can say is that I respect your point of view.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	293	The question is: Would you be able to say the same?
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	294	I've just responded to this notion of potential life so I will answer your questionin in regard to respecting your point of view.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	294	Your are free to hold it.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	294	Although I disagree with it strongly I would never use the force of law or anything to prevent you from holding it and expressing it, that is true tolerance.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	294	However, ideas have consequences and some ideas are deadly.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	294	So I would say that some ideas are vastly superior to others.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	294	What Mother Teresa did was a superior idea than what jihadist are doing.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	294	But jihadist are human and therefore are valuable human beings worthy of dignity and respect.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	294	So as humans I respect them but it's their ideas that I don't respect.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	294	So all that to say that I'm egalitarian regarding persons and an elitist regarding ideas.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	294	So as a human I will treat you with dignity and respect but I can't say I will do that with all your ideas, only the ones that are good by objective standards.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	295	And I will further say that since I'm egalitarian regarding persons I will not engage in ad hominem because it is at the man.  I will go after your ideas with a vengeance however because i differentiate between the person and their ideas.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	296	FYI an embryo is a stage of life it's not the thing.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	296	Your argument therefore falters because of equivocation.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	296	And furthermore person hood is a characteristic of the thing, not the thing.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	296	And finally, I don't discriminate against humans; it's just plain wrong.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	296	All humans, especially ones in the early stages of development, are worthy of or full protection.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	296	That's called moral clarity.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	297	No, it's called moral absolutism and it's intelectually lazy because it means that you refuse to actually think about the issue and use personal judgement when deciding what is right and wrong.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	297	No one likes getting an abortion, and everyone would be happier if there were less abortions; however, in the very early stages when all there is, is a clump of cells, a woman should be able to choose whether she want sto conitinue with the pregancy.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	297	In addition, we already have systems in place that grant increasing rights with age, so I don't see how this case is any different.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	298	Well if I'm intellectually lazy because I can look at a murder and without thinking say it is wrong, than I'm guilty as charged.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	298	And I will wear that label with honor.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	298	But tell me why you think no one likes getting an abortion, and why everyone would be happier if there were less abortions.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	298	And about that "clump of cells" are they cancer cells?
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	298	if not, what kind of cells are they?
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	298	Finally,In addition, we already have systems in place that grant increasing rights with age, so I don't see how this case is any different.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	298	True, however life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guarantied to all of them expect those in the early stages of development, those in their mothers womb.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	298	That's discrimination based on level of development and that's just plain wrong.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	298	The most dangerous place in America shouldn't be a mother's womb
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	299	Looking at the world in black and white with complete disregard for reality is intelectually lazy, and I'm not at all shy to say it.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	299	The world is complicated, and when you look at it through an uncompromising moralistic lense you end up oversimplifying problems and giving simplistic answers.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	299	Calling abortion murder is simplistic and misses the point of the debate.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	299	I am doing my best to discuss the issue as rationally as possible but when you make statements likeWell if I'm intellectually lazy because I can look at a murder and without thinking say it is wrong, than I'm guilty as chargedit makes it really difficult to continue.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	299	Of course no one wants to get an abortion.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	299	Whether you believe it to be murder or not, it's still a sad event and you'd have to be heartless not to feel something.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	299	What I am arguing is that banning abortion is not the best way to reduce the suffering that unwanted pregancies causes.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	299	Instead we should concentrate on improving sex education, and helping increase the standard of living of the poor (a group that is disproportionately more likely to have unwanted pregancies and get abortions).
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	299	I know this is difficult for you to understand on your moral high horse, but stop and consider that there might be more to the issue then the oversimplified version that has been hammered into your thick little skull since birth.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	299	I'm sorry but a single cell's rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness do not trump the right a woman to choose whether or not she wants to be a mother.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	299	We are talking about something that doesn't exist as a thinking feeling human being, and I don't understand why you can't rap your head around the idea of increasing rights as development occurs.
andsoccer16	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	299	The most dangerous place in America shouldn't be a mother's wombI agree, and that's why I said that a viable fetus should be considered a full human being, however you choose again and again to ignore this fact.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	Looking at the world in black and white is called moral clarity.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	Somethings are obviously wrong like theft, rape and murder.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	To say otherwise would be foolish and be to deny the obvious.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	Now you may use your intellect to justify those acts but then your intellect becomes complicit in the act.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	Not a place I want to go.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	Of course no one wants to get an abortionIf that were true no one would get an abortion.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	People get abortions because they want to.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	In regards to "feel something" and "the suffering that unwanted pregnancies causes" You seem to miss the greater suffering and depression women feel after an abortion, a suffering that last a life time.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	That suffering is far greater than that of finding out you got pregnant.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	That's the suffering I want to end.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	Not to mention the trauma of the child which just lead Nebraska to ban abortions after 20 weeks.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	It's called The Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	I don't understand why you can't rap your head around the idea of increasing rights as development occurs.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	Because it is wrong to base the value of another human on subjective terms like those.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	Adopting subjective standards makes it possible for the strong to exploit the weak and that's exactly what your standard does.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	You ought to be protecting the weak and innocent, not using your intellect to come up with ways to justify their killing.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	For example you saida viable fetus should be considered a full human being.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	So those that are not, are not human?
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	You've just stripped them of their objective humanity by your subjective definition of humanity and now you feel justified in killing them, I'm sorry but that's not proper justification.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	I do hope you can see how dangerous your point of view is because it puts even your life in danger if logically followed through.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	All I have to do is be more powerful than you and determine that your life is not viable by my standards and then I'm free to kill you; might makes right.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	That's why abortion should be banned, because all human life is valuable by the fact that it is human.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	If we move the value from the objective to the subjective than no one is safe and we have turned the law on it's head because laws are meant to protect people.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	But who is a person is subject to the opinion of another.
jstantall	andsoccer16	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	300	I don't know about you but I never would want to be treated like that.

NVYN	alstars	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	303	Friend, it has nothing to do with you unless you can keep it alive yourself.
NVYN	alstars	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	303	Before the fetus turns at least 20 weeks old, it has no chance of survival outside of the mother's womb.
NVYN	alstars	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	303	This means she alone should have the choice.
NVYN	alstars	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	303	You should not butt in just because of your own feelings.
NVYN	alstars	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	303	Consider other people's feelings, consider the people who are directly affected by this.
NVYN	alstars	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	303	They should have the choice to keep the pregnancy or not before it turns 20 weeks.

zbs28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	304	Abortion should be legal.
zbs28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	304	The government should never have the right to make decisions pertaining to one's own body and/or a decision to bring a child into the world or not.
zbs28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	304	It takes the moral responsibility to do what is right away from the individual and this would cause us to become more and more conditioned to behave in whatever ways the establishment chooses to mold us.
zbs28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	304	It would contradict the very core of what it means to be free.
zbs28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	304	If we make abortion illegal, shouldn't we also make adoption?
zbs28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	304	In case you don't know, the business of adoption is in the billions per year.
zbs28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	304	Making abortion illegal would bolster this industry even further, and allow desperate people to become "baby merchants", for profit.
zbs28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	304	An example would be a girlfriend of mine who needed money and decided to sell her eggs.
zbs28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	304	What moral ground does that hold?
zbs28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	304	Not to mention the financial burden more children would put on the American people in light of high inflation and low wages, health care costs, education etc.  Forcing you to keep a child could very well sink many families into poverty.
zbs28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	304	To me, the person undertaking an abortion has enough to deal with that they don't need my opinion on their moral character on top of it.
zbs28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	304	They don't need my judgement because they're the ones having to live with that decision.
zbs28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	304	And of course legal abortion would come with regulations to protect it from abuse.
zbs28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	304	I think there's a lot that can be done to provide people the freedom of choice without allowing them to abuse that freedom, just like many other things in this country.

NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	306	But it should not be made compulsory, which is essentially what happens if you ban abortion.
kmac	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	307	that is 100% my opinon too!
kmac	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	307	if your not adult enought to take care of what comes along with having sex then don't think that your adult enought to have it people need to GROW UP!
thWIIsixty	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	308	Yes it is true that abortion is immorally wrong.
thWIIsixty	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	308	However, one must think about what will happen if abortion is banned.
thWIIsixty	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	308	If something is banned, is it completely gone?
thWIIsixty	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	308	Look at prohibition in the 20's and look at weed now.
thWIIsixty	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	308	They were never gone, just made illegal.
thWIIsixty	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	308	If abortion is illegal then someone who made a mistake in having sex, such as a teen, can't tell anyone about it for obvious reasons.
thWIIsixty	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	308	The only person she tells is a best friend and she can't have the baby because the parents will find out so her only option is abortion.
thWIIsixty	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	308	OH WAIT!
thWIIsixty	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	308	Abortion is illegal so she has to go to some old lady in the trailer park or do it herself with a coat hangar, either way she will end up with a disease (that I can't remember the name).
thWIIsixty	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	308	Abortion is wrong but should not be illegal.
thWIIsixty	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	308	Also, I really don't want to sound mean or offensive but this probably is: Abortion will help with population control.
thWIIsixty	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	308	Our world's population is increasing faster than ever.
thWIIsixty	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	308	we need to keep our resources.
thWIIsixty	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	308	And the main people that want abortions are usually careless people or rape victims.
thWIIsixty	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	308	Most families would either be able to take care of the child or be courteous enough to put the baby up for adoption.
thWIIsixty	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	308	So I guess it really all comes down to practicing safe sex and coming down harder on rapists.
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	309	The debate isn't about "should people put up unwanted babies for adoption".

SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	310	What exacly is the valid and direct issue of compulsory adoption.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	310	Surely you must admit that it does a better job than an abortion?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	311	Ok, here's a very real issue of making adoption compulsory: You must make the woman carry the child to full term for somebody else to have the baby.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	311	This is while the woman may feel deeply offended/embarrassed/disadvantaged by the pregnancy, and her body is on the line!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	312	The women shouldn't be having unprotected sex in the first place.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	312	Rape is an entirely different subject.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	313	You can make unprotected sex illegal, don't make abortions illegal.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	314	Then what happens?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	314	Unprotect sex becomes the next 'underground drug.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	314	'I'm sure you can fill in the blanks from there.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	315	Unprotected sex is the point of creating a child.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	315	While you're at it, ask for a law to be passed that all children must die.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	315	After all, it's practically what you're asking for.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	315	Anything else is just "messing around.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	316	Ok, now you're being dramatic and it's not funny at all.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	316	If you're not a woman experiencing PMS then you really have no excuse, but if you are then calm down and see my point.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	316	It's really quite workable:Ok, what I mean is make "sex that results in an unwanted pregnancy" illegal.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	316	Ok, unwanted pregnancy is the key.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	316	Having sex risks pregnancy, everyone knows that, just like driving without wearing your seatbelt risks serious injury.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	316	You can risk it if you want, but when the unexpected result happens, you have a choice: You can decide if you WANT the pregnancy OR NOT.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	316	If you decide that you don't WANT the pregnancy, then the law kicks in!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	316	A hefty fine is a very good deterent.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	316	You can build the cost of the fine into the cost of an abortion.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	316	This would make the cost of an abortion very very expensive.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	316	The proceeds from this could all go into funding educational programs about sex and pregnancy, counselling, etc. . .  You can even build in a jail term for the guilty if you feel that monetary fines aren't enough.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	316	So, as with seatbelt wearing in a car, over a short period, people would all learn to do it responsibly and it will become second nature and not have to be such an issue.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	316	Don't make it illegal, regulate it and everyone's a winner.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	317	FINING UNPROTECTED SEX?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	317	So what?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	317	Do you plan on having the Government check every couple for a condom in the middle of it all?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	317	That is a serious invasion of privacy.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	317	The system would not work.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	317	Simple.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	317	The concept of jail-time is just ridiculous, surely you must even see how ridiculous that actually is.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	318	Does the Government check all moving cars for a seatbelt wearer?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	318	YOU are ridiculous.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	318	A "serious invasion of privacy", you say?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	318	But forcing people to do something with their body is not?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	318	Contradiction!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	318	So, my suggestion is not ridiculous.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	318	YOU are ridiculous.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	318	YOUR arguments are ridiculous.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	318	YOU should go live in a country run by dictatorship.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	318	YOU should deal with YOUR unwanted pregnancies in YOUR OWN way.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	318	Leave it alone.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	318	Abortion should not be banned.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	319	Reality check required?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	319	Is your statement an argument or a personal attack?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	319	Clearly you are indeed a fool if you believe that I am suggesting an imediate termination and outlaw on abortion.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	319	I, as many do, believe that we can work towards the issue, rather than circling it as people like you do.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	319	Who do you defend with your outrageous suggestions?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	319	The mother?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	319	From what exactly?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	319	The point of it all is to prevent an unwanted prenancy, we can agree on that.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	319	You suggest terminating part of the problem, I suggest that we create a solution to the entire situation.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	319	And, yeah, that reality check I mentioned, it may very well be overdue.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	320	I'm attacking your illogical mind and your silly arguments!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	320	If that's a personal attack, then I guess that's what it is! Ok so you're not calling for abortion to be outlawed, why then are you arguing for their side?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	320	You should argue for our side or at the very least choose the "it depends" option!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	320	I know you want to educate (as do I), so educate, and if that works out well in the future you won't find it necessary to ban abortion!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	320	I'm not defending anybody with my outrageous suggestions.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	320	It's a solution to a problem, which is unwanted pregnancies.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	320	It has more educational value then a ban on abortion.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	320	Hit people where the pocket is and help them avoid a mistake in the future, don't make them pay for their mistake by forcing them to bring up a child.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	320	Forcing someone to keep a pet against their will can have dire consequences for the animal concerned, you get my point?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	320	The only reality check here is that a ban on abortion simply doesn't work.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	320	It doesn't work to educate, it simply makes it . . .
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	320	what did you call it?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	320	ah yes.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	320	"the next underground drug".
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	321	Yeah, and I make "silly arguments.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	321	"Illegal abortions, wow, I never would have guessed.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	321	Oh, sorry, you're serious?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	321	Seriously in need of that reality check, perhaps.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	321	Apart from that, perhaps, you have a point.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	321	Fine, this argument can be defined as "after education", as in: "after education has come into play with success.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	321	"I am now abandoning this debate, my reasons have already been stated.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	321	Have fun with, whatever, I'll be doing my usual, I'm sure you already understand.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	322	Goodbye.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	322	And apply some energy to thinking about how to make your arguments more understandable and persuasive logically.
atypican	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	323	The debate is not about whether or not abortion is sometimes the best course of action, but whether or not a government agency has the right to make laws mandating that a pregnant woman carry a child to term.
atypican	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	323	There are various good reasons for terminating a pregnancy.
atypican	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	323	There are even more reasons a woman may choose to abort that are not good.
atypican	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	323	Is it the business of the state to intervene and evaluate the reasoning process that the woman and her doctor apply when making these tough decisions?
atypican	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	323	I don't think so.
atypican	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	323	Allowing government entities to have the final irrevocable say in such situations sets a precedent that puts the government in a too high of a position relative to our fundamental liberties.
atypican	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	323	What can we do short of legislation to significantly reduce the number of abortions performed when there are better options?
atypican	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	323	People like me who abhor abortion need to focus on putting the alternatives front and center.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	324	You say;There are various good reasons for terminating a pregnancy.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	324	I'd like to hear one.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	324	But to answer your question about the role of government in these affairs please consider the following:"We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	324	"Taking the life of another person is an injustice, destroys domestic tranquility, destroys general welfare and robs the individual of the blessings of liberty, If government has no authority to protect an individuals unalienable rights what good is it?
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	324	This is how our Founding Fathers saw it:"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	324	— That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness"Please note the use of the word "all" The decision handed down in Roe vs Wade stripped a whole class of people their rights by denying their humanity.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	324	This ruling goes against the very Constitution itself; It is a disgrace.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	324	As I said earlier it turns the law on it's head, the very law it is supposed to uphold.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	324	It appears this court has become destructive of the purpose for which it was founded and according to the Deceleration of Independence it is our duty to do something about.

atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	326	In some cases an abortion may be life saving to the pregnant woman.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	326	I don't think that a woman who chooses abortion to save her own life is committing an immoral act.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	326	Taking the life of another person is an injusticeIn general I agree that is true, but you yourself admit that sometimes it is justifiable to take a life DO YOU NOT?

atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	326	I never said that "government has no authority to protect an individuals unalienable rights".
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	326	Whatever just authority it does have is derived from the consent of the governed.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	326	How far do we let government go "protecting" us.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	326	There are a million more laws I'm sure that can be shoved down our throats in the name of protection.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	326	Our right to privacy applies at some point, and I think health care decisions made in a doctor's office merit that privacy from government intrusion.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	327	That scenario of the endangered mother is rare.

jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	327	When we as a people deny that right to a whole class of people we have undercut ourselves.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	327	In regards the taking of life; I agree with you, but not when it comes to abortion.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	327	And just to be clear, an unjustified action is unjust.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	327	I'm convinced that an abortion is unjustified for the reasons commonly given.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	327	In regards how far: I think the Constitution makes that clear, but Roe vs Wade undercuts that very Constitution.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	327	This isn't a debate about some theoretically fetus somewhere.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	327	This is about the 1500 lives that are snuffed out daily in our land and it's about you and I because it affects you and I.  Don't think laws like this can stand without serious ramifications.

atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	328	maybe not based on, but exceptions to the norm should at times bear heavily during the legislative process.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	328	The right to life is the most fundamental right, everything else stands or falls on this one issue.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	328	So the argument is. . .  that since the right to privacy from government intrusion is not as of high a priority as the right to life, the government therefore ought to have full access to any medical health records related to pregnant women so they can follow up and make sure abortions are not performed by state licensed doctors?
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	328	If a teen girl was found pregnant she could be arrested for underage sex and could carry to term while incarcerated.

atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	328	jeezI think that in a very real sense, the right to "reproductive privacy" precedes the "right to life".
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	328	I would love to read a response to this particular point.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	328	In regards the taking of life; I agree with you, but not when it comes to abortion.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	328	Yes I understand you are a firm proponent of the death penalty.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	328	isn't it true?
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	328	oh right I remember the logic "You don't make laws based on exceptions to the norm"You don't have to convince me that high abortion rates represent the deepest poverty.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	328	I need to be convinced that government intervention (invasion to the privacy thereof) in doctor/pregnant woman relations is merited.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	328	Remember I think that the right to life depends on reproductive privacy.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	329	Let me address the point you are making here:that since the right to privacy from government intrusion is not as of high a priority as the right to life, the government therefore ought to have full access to any medical health records related to pregnant women so they can follow up and make sure abortions are not performed by state licensed doctors?
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	329	If I'm torturing little babies in my basement are you saying that I have a right to privacy from government intrusion?
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	329	And if I'm a doctor I have more of a right to do what I want?
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	329	Don't you think this goes against one of the reasons for licensing doctors, public safety?
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	329	Again I say; If a government has not right to protect life, what good is it.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	329	On the issue of the death penalty.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	329	The principal in play for me on this issue and abortion is the same; the sanctity of human life.
atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	330	If I'm torturing little babies in my basement are you saying that I have a right to privacy from government intrusion?

atypican	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	330	You think that a doctor/pregnant woman relationship should not be private but court monitored to make sure doctors don't commit murder.

helloim123	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	331	Very little of all abortions are performed because of the baby threatening the mother's life.
helloim123	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	331	Even less abortions are performed because the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.

Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	332	Nothing about the abortion right is unconstitutional, because (get ready for it): a fetus is not a person.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	332	Neverin the history of U. S.  law has a fetus been a "person," and a fetus is not a "person" under the law of the EU either.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	332	Are you getting the part where you went wrong yet?
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	333	The question is not about person-hood, but humanity and that is genetically verifiable.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	333	Answer the question, what kind of being is it?
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	333	Everything else is superfluous.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	333	And just so you know what side you stand on; your argument is similar to those who supported slavery,they are not full persons and therefore have no rights under the law.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	333	So let me qoute you using the word slavery in place of fetus and maybe you can see where you went wrongNothing about the right to slavery is unconstitutional, because (get ready for it): a slave is not a person.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	333	Never in the history of U. S.  law has a slave been a "person," and a slave is not a "person" under the law of Britain either.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	333	A slave is property and therefore one can do with it as one sees fit.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	334	Your argument fails in that a human who has been born, whether freed or enslaved, is a life in being -- i. e. , someone who is an autonomous life fully developed to the point of not being physiologically dependent on another being for basic bodily functions.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	334	We recognize that autonomous, born human beings share certain basic rights.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	334	These rights do not extend to clumps of cells which are wholly dependent on another living being for their existence.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	334	Therefore your analogy does not actually equate at all.

jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	335	But let's say they are for the sake of the argument; what kind of cells are they?

jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	335	On the issue of dependency: you are wholly dependent on other living beings for your existence.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	335	By your logic it would be OK to kill you if the issue of dependency was all that was needed to justify your death.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	335	And further more we could extend this to the mentally and physically handicapped.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	335	It could apply to the sick and suffering, people with cancer and all those in hospitals.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	335	The logic you use is exactly the logic the Third Reich used when it began doing these very things; long before it got to exterminating 6 million Jews.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	335	You may agree with the Third Reich that there is such thing as a life unworthy of life, but I don't.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	335	A child conceived is worthy of life and should have every opportunity to live it.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	336	Your argument is specious.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	336	The sick and handicapped are not at issue.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	336	People with cancer are not at issue.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	336	None of them have hooked themselves up to the bodies of autonomous adults whose physiological functions are then used to regulate their own.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	336	And of course, the first one to make an overblown comparison between the issue at hand and Nazism is inevitably the loser in any given debate.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	337	I'm questioning the underlying principle in play here and there is a connection between all the examples I gave.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	337	if you can't see the underlying principle here I don't know what to tell you.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	337	The argument looks like this:X is not worthy of life because of Y, therefore we're justified in killing it.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	337	Now just put Jews, slaves, embryos or what ever in place of "X" and put your reason in place of "Y" and you've got your argument.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	337	Can you see the analogy between them now?
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	337	So my principal objection is with the "Y" when you have an embryo for "X"
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	338	Jews, slaves, etc.  are all beings in their own right, not dependent on the womb of another.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	338	So no, your argument does not hold up.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	339	Notice what you have done; You've imposed an arbitrary standard (dependent on the womb of another) and then said it is OK to kill any human being who doesn't meet this standard.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	339	That standard can be slid anywhere up or down, from conception to old age.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	339	It's what is know as moral relativism and it's a morally bankrupt ethic.
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	339	The question is not; at what point can we kill it, but what isit?
jstantall	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	339	You need to first establish that this standard of yours is morally justified because I'm not persuaded that it is.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	340	Old age?
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	340	How's that work?
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	340	No "human being" is going to be dependent on the womb of another for more than about 10 months.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	340	Once it's out of the womb, it is by definition no longer dependent on said womb for survival.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	340	The standard is flexible, not arbitrary.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	340	It is flexible to a certain defined degree (as it should be) and that degree should, to my thinking, correspond to the level of prenatal physiological development.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	340	In other words, rights vest as the being grows and matures.
ccaruana	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	341	He has a good point: you are making a standard of "dependent on the womb of another," but that only serves to further your point that abortion is morally blameless.
ccaruana	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	341	There are many other categories of human beings that are dependent on another in a manner very similar to that of a fetus to the womb.
ccaruana	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	341	Handicapped people are a good example of this, and, depending on the severity of their handicap may be just as incapable of independent life as a fetus.
ccaruana	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	341	I am in agreement that the government shouldn't be mandating the legality of abortion, but I am also of the belief that it is immoral.
ccaruana	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	341	The two do not necessarily overlap since legality and morality are not synonymous.
ccaruana	Banshee	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	341	The question here is a question of legality, not of morality.

Banshee	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	343	Yup, that's your right, but since SCOTUS has already rejected "it's a person it's a child" not just once but many times, continuing to just assert "it's a person it's a child" while citing to a video from 25 years ago is probably not a very strong argument with which to challenge the law.

NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	345	Society can then decide if it wants to outlaw abortions after this period, when the baby can actually become a person independent of its mother.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	346	I'd like add a different perspective to your argument.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	346	I've changed one key word, tell me if it changes anything.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	346	The debate is not about whether or not slavery is sometimes the best course of action, but whether or not a government agency has the right to make laws mandating that a man may not have a slave.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	346	There are various good reasons for having slaves.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	346	There are even more reasons a man may choose to have a slave that are not good.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	346	Is it the business of the state to intervene and evaluate the reasoning process that the buyer and seller apply when making these tough decisions?
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	346	I don't think so.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	346	Allowing government entities to have the final irrevocable say in such situations sets a precedent that puts the government in a too high of a position relative to our fundamental liberties.
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	346	What can we do short of legislation to significantly reduce the number of slaves traded when there are better options?
jstantall	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	346	People like me who abhor slavery need to focus on putting the alternatives front and center.

NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	347	A fetus that's not capable of survival without being directly attached to its mother via the umbilical cord is still not yet a person that merits society's involvement.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	347	It is the mother's property until this point and she must have the choice of keeping it or not.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	347	You must not force someone to keep something alive within her because you can't do it yourself.

jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	348	Keeping slaves and aborting a fetus is not the same thingNever said it was, only the logic behind it.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	348	Here is an example:It is the mother's propertyFYI that's the same logic that was used to justify the beating of slaves; it was the slave master's property.

NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	349	The fetusreallyis the mother's property naturally (she created it and didn't have to buy it from anyone) , whereas the slave is bought or forced to be his/her owner's property.

NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	349	The 2 things are not the same.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	350	Somebody flunked biology didn't they?

NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	351	You keep saying that it's human, which I agree with you.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	351	The points of difference seems to be that I regard it as apotentialup to a certain point, whereas you think of it more as adefinite.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	351	You then argue that it deserves all the same rights as that of people.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	351	I don't agree I'm afraid.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	351	It doesn't deserve the same rights and you can call this discrimination based on level of development ;) (not based on level of dependency as you keep saying).
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	351	Until it passes a certain stage in its development (mental and physical), it shouldn't have any rights whatsoever.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	Here is what I think you are saying by potential life; This human after a certain point can go on and have a life.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	And by life I'm guessing you mean it in the generic sense, meaning the totality of ones existence, a life lived.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	Here is why I think that is a dangerous position to hold.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	Basing the value of a human on it's potential is a subjective value judgment, someone other than the human in question decides the value of the human life.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	If someone decides that the life of someone else is not valuable they then are free to dispose of it.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	That's dangerous because that is how Germany began the road to the holocaust.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	It started with the sick, mentally retarded and elderly.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	The did it by making the value judgment that certain humans didn't have potential, they held no value for society.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	And following Darwin's model of survival of the fittest it was only logical to dispose of them.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	See potential is a very vague and subjective term that can be defined in a multitude of different ways, it's what's know as an equivocal word.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	You see when a value judgment is subjective the line between value and no value can be easily moved to suite the desire of the one with power making every human at risk, even you.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	The safer ground to stand on is objective value.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	The value of the human is in the human itself.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	By the fact that it is human gives it it's value.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	This puts all humans on a level playing field.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	I can't come up to you and because I have more power than you say your life is not as valuable as mine.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	Taking the position of objective value protects the weakest and most vulnerable members of the human race.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	We are not free to exploit them because we are more powerful.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	I hope you see that by making this subjective value judgment of another human being you have raised yourself above them because you are more powerful.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	And now because of your power over them you can kill them freely, this is nothing short of the exploitation of the weakest and most vulnerable humans.
jstantall	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	352	Conscience ought to tell you that we should protect them, not exploit them.
yachy101	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	353	i agree 100 percent with you.
yachy101	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	353	the government shouldnt force someone to not have an abortion.
zbs28	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	354	I agree 100%.
zbs28	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	354	This is a cultural issue and not a political one.
NVYN	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	355	That's right.
NVYN	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	355	It's inside the woman.
NVYN	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	355	It's a part of her body like any other organs inside her.
NVYN	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	355	Until it can survive outside her womb, it's her choice whether she wants to continue to allow it to develop into a human life.
NVYN	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	355	What happens after week 20 when theoretically it can survive outside her womb?
NVYN	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	355	Well then society, if it so chooses, can keep it alive and would have the right to intervene.
NVYN	atypican	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	355	Until then, society has no rights.
anotherguy34	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	356	Poor argument,A woman's genetic code is different from the code of the baby's therefore its clearly a separate entity.
anotherguy34	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	356	To kill a separate entity is murder.
DaddySays	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	357	This is stupid.
DaddySays	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	357	The simple fact of all of this is let people decide what they want to do with teir bodies, I am so sick of republicans saying "no more government" then they have these "rules" which make more decisions for us.
DaddySays	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	357	Total hypocrisy.
DaddySays	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	357	You have a right to choose is my stance on everything.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	I wrote this speech.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	read it and it will answer your questions.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	Abortion: Choose Life-it begins at Conception:Think about this.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	A girl had an abortion, thinking that the baby wasn’t living so it wouldn’t matter.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	But, after she had the abortion, she saw what she thought wasn’t living, and it actually was.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	The baby was living and she watched it die.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	From then on, she couldn’t even live with herself knowing that she killed a living human being.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	This story that I just told you is true.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	A lot of women think that it isn’t a baby before they have the abortion, and I will explain to you that abortion is the killing of a living baby.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	Well, if life doesn’t begin at birth, then when does it begin?
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	Life begins at conception.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	This is a fact, because there is a lot of proof that can back that fact up.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	For example, there is scientific proof and there is Biblical proof.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	To further explain what abortion is, I will talk about these important things: one, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, two, how scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception, Three, what we can do about the abortions, and finally, why girls get abortions.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	Those are all the things that should be thought about, so I will be explaining them, to help you understand them.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	Some woman have abortions because of these three things: one, They might think that they’re too young to have a baby, two, their boyfriend or spouse makes them have an abortion, three, if they do have the abortion the girl’s parents would get mad at her.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	The case also might be that she just doesn’t want to deal with the baby.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	First, you probably ought to know what abortion is.  Abortion is killing the baby inside you when you are pregnant.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	Every year 1.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	5 million babies are killed by abortion.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	That’s 125,000 babies killed a month, making it 4,000 babies killed each day, or one baby killed every 20 seconds, that is so amazingly awful.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	That is basically one murder happening every 20 seconds.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	How brutal.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	The fact that life begins at conception is spiritually right.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	As it says in the Bible; Jeremiah 1:5 says, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	” The Bible says that life begins at conception, meaning that right at conception the baby becomes a living human being.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	There are many Bible verses that back up the fact that life begins at conception, like the one I just said.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	That Bible verse, Jeremiah 1:5 is saying that God intended a unique human being, starting at conception.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	Just because you can’t see or feel the baby inside of you, doesn’t mean it’s not a baby, and alive and a human being, just like you.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	That is what a lot of people do not think about, even though you really should.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	There also is scientific proof.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	Some people may think that life begins at birth, or some people even later, but that is wrong, life begins at conception.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	Because of the fact that the baby forms gradually after conception, then conception is the only real point where you can say that the baby is a living human being.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	For example, the heart beat starts gradually, over a period of time so conception is the only exact starting point of life.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	Also, DNA defines a separate human being, and so when does a person form their own DNA?
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	A person gets their own DNA at conception.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	That is a whole lot of proof, so it is just like saying it is a crime to kill a 1 year old, so why isn’t it a crime to kill a baby when he or she is still in the mother’s womb?
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	That is a question that probably will go unanswered forever, or they will just say that the baby is not living, which is a complete lie.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	Now, what can we do about abortion?
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	There many things that we can do about abortion.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	If you start supporting this pro-life movement then it will keep growing so much then no one will have an abortion.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	Hopefully then the abortion clinics will shut down, and the law will have to change.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	But, most importantly you can change the hearts of the people who support abortion, and save the innocent little babies.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	Now, how can we stop abortion?
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	There are many ways to help stop abortion.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	Another way is you can donate money to a place like The Pregnancy Resource Center and they will use it to buy an ultrasound machine and to then show the women their babies to try to convince them not to have an abortion.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	You can also write to the president or another government representative, and tell them about all this proof that I have told you, hoping that their hearts will change and then the law.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	In conclusion to all of this, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, and scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	There are many ways that you can help stop abortion, so I hope that you take a while and do that.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	There are a lot of things wrong with having an abortion, so you really should not have one.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	Just remember that God loves the person getting the abortion AND the beautiful, innocent little babies.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	Thank you and I hope that you have realized that life begins at conception, you should help the pro-life movement, and that having an abortion is wrong.
nattymoon24	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	358	WORDS: 981
DaddySays	nattymoon24	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	359	Um, that doesnt prove anything except what it actually is.  When a woman becomes pregnant she starts going through a hormonal change to adjust for this really huge thing that is about to happen to her life.
DaddySays	nattymoon24	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	359	It is natures way of preparing a woman for motherhood.
DaddySays	nattymoon24	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	359	When the baby is lost, through abortion, miscarriage, or accident, all women go back to normal hormones in a quick fashion and it causes depression.
DaddySays	nattymoon24	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	359	If you think that a woman feeling guilty about the abortion isnt misplaced emotion then let me tell you a general story that I am sure relates to every woman on the planet.
DaddySays	nattymoon24	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	359	When you get all emotional and upset because your bf or husband does not put the dishes in the right place or some other lame ass reason for getting upset, do you really think that that is really the issue?
DaddySays	nattymoon24	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	359	Is it really not your period or your mom not listening to you?
DaddySays	nattymoon24	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	359	Yes it is.  So misunderstanding your emotions and where they stem from is how you define "woman".
jstantall	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	360	There is a name for that it's called Anarchy and every society that embraces it collapses.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	361	The direct opposite of anarchy is dictatorship.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	361	trying to legislate and take away people's rights in regards to their own bodies.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	361	societies that embrace dictatorships also collapse in time.
SMCdeBater	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	362	Let me get this straight; you are suggesting that there should be a yes/no policy on every aspect on life?
SMCdeBater	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	362	If I choose not to pay my taxes, I am fined and jailed.
SMCdeBater	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	362	If I choose to kill, I am also jailed.
SMCdeBater	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	362	If I choose to ignore the Stop Signs while driving, I could cause several kinds of accidents.
SMCdeBater	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	362	If I choose to disobey the law, I am a criminal.
SMCdeBater	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	362	Have a think about where I am going with this.
SMCdeBater	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	362	While you're at it, add to the list, see how far you get before you realize how wrong your statement was.
August	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	363	But who is going to choose for the unborn child?
August	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	363	Like I said was premature, if my parents had chosen to abort me then I would never had the chance to call out my ideas, have you ever thought of that?
NVYN	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	364	If you were aborted, you wouldn't be here right now.
NVYN	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	364	But that means nothing!
NVYN	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	364	It may hurt your feelings to know that you're only a small speck of dust in the universe (as am I), but life in general goes on without us my friend.
NVYN	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	364	You could greatly contribute to society but then again you could also turn out to be extremely evil.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	365	Actually, you're wrong.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	365	By that I refer to your statement of: "If you were aborted, you wouldn't be here right now.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	365	But that means nothing!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	365	"One man makes a difference, and yes, this can and does affect the world.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	365	Man is the most dominant species on Earth, as I'm sure you would agree, and it is because of this that certain choices of ours greatly impacts the planet.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	365	Greenhouse gases is one example, Nuclear War is another.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	365	To be honest, there are many things I have done that have affected the world, all of which relate to Greenhouse Gas emissions and preventions.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	365	Anyway, my point is that one man makes a difference, whether we are born or not makes a difference.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	365	The level of difference varies, as all men/women are not created equal.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	365	It shouldn't be a choice of do we come into this world, but should be what we will do with the time we have while we are here.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	366	Ok, let's just agree that "one man DOES make a difference".
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	366	That difference however, can be positive or negative.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	366	I have already said that he could turn out to be a peace loving buhdah, or he could be worse then Hitler.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	366	It's all a possibility.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	366	Let's not get into possibilities.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	366	we could be here forever arguing about things that will never be.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	367	Hah, finally, something we can agree upon.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	367	Possibilities are endless, and with abortion, we will never know.

reinarealta	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	368	my father, and i got pregnant at the age of 14, it would not be mentally healthy for me to go through with my pregnancy!
reinarealta	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	368	It would wreak havoc on my own psyche and screw my child over from the abnormal hormone fluctuations [stress is bad for the baby in utero].
reinarealta	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	368	If the pregnancy would be damaging in any way to the mother, because it really is her choice, I believe abortion is appropriate.
reinarealta	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	368	I AM NOT SAYING IT SHOULD BE USED AS BIRTH CONTROL.
reinarealta	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	368	If you have more than one abortion because of your own stupid mistakes, then yes, you most definitely carry the baby to term and put it up for adoption.
reinarealta	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	368	But if the pregnancy is going to be damaging, get the abortion as soon as possible.
lhallgren	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	369	No abortion should not be banned, it is the peoples choice if they wish to have a child not be forced to have it, especially if they are young.

August	lhallgren	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	370	For one thing people are forced to do things all the time and i suggest you watch an abortion.
August	lhallgren	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	370	Did you know that they just vacume it out like a dust bunny as it is screaming and its limbs are being torn off?

NVYN	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	371	People who use graphical images of abortions to argue against it are actually quite lame.

NVYN	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	371	It's quite horrific watching flesh sliced open, but should it be used to argue against surgical operations?
NVYN	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	371	All this graphical arguments are pathetic desperate measures to try and convince people it's ok to be forced to do something, that they should allow their rights regarding their own bodies to be taken away.

SilentSound	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	376	If you believe abortion is wrong don't have one, but don't push your beliefs on someone else who feels differently because of your own self-righteousness.
NVYN	SilentSound	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	377	That's right!
NVYN	SilentSound	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	377	It's a personal choice until the fetus can survive outside the mother's womb.
NVYN	SilentSound	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	377	This is around 20 weeks into the pregnancy.
NVYN	SilentSound	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	377	After that, society can decide what to do with it because they can theoretically intervene and keep it alive without the mother.
NVYN	SilentSound	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	377	Society wants to make laws, it should stick to areas that it could actually control.
Prevaricate	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	378	this is a tiresome argument.

NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	380	I know you're trying to say that legislations are necessary to prevent chaos.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	380	But you're comparing 2 very different things.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	380	You're proposing that the rights to a person's own body should be legislated away.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	380	It's called living in a prison!
kamranw	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	381	There needs to be improved sex ed in society.
kamranw	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	381	How does that solve this issue?
kamranw	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	381	Just because people will try to do something outside the law, does not mean the government should just make it legal.
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	382	"just because people will try to do something outside the law, doesn't mean the govt should just make it legal".
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	382	are you suggesting that abortions are already "outside the law"?
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	382	It's happening everywhere and it is everyone's rights to their own body.
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	382	It's not outside the law unless you make it so!
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	382	Besides, making certain recreational drugs legal allow certain societies to control it better.
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	382	This may be the case with abortions.
kamranw	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	383	are you suggesting that abortions are already "outside the law"?
kamranw	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	383	No. . . .
kamranw	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	383	I was responding to the post that "people will just get illegal abortions anyway" I was simply pointing out that is not a good reason to keep or make something legal.
kamranw	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	383	"Besides, making certain recreational drugs legal allow certain societies to control it better"Considering these drugs are NOT legal, you have no proof to back that statement up.
kamranw	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	383	Secondly, you cannot compare the 2.
kamranw	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	383	Abortions would most likely go down if it was illegal as most people would be too scared to do them illegally.

jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	385	Why not set high standards for them sexually also, since nothing curtails an education like a pregnancy.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	385	Abstinence is the only practice that provides 100% protection against STDs and pregnancy, nothing else comes close.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	385	There is only one question when it comes to abortion, what is it?
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	385	If it is a human being then it requires a very high level of justification to take it's life.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	385	I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of an innocent human being.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	385	The only arguments I have seen are those that try to take away the embryo's humanity and make it less than human.

Prevaricate	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	386	I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of an innocent human being.
Prevaricate	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	386	"are you concerned about only the innocent unborn embryo or all innocent life?
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	387	Yes, all innocent life.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	387	But that depends on how you define innocent life.
Prevaricate	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	388	it is simple - innocent simply means free of blame, not guilty, not in the wrong, etc.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	389	Yes, all innocent life.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	389	So -- vegetarian, then?
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	390	You can't get pregnant or contract an STD if your not having sex outside of marriage.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	390	Well, that's totally goofy and wrong.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	390	Married women get pregnant all the time.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	390	(Oh and here's a total shocker: not all married womenwantto get pregnant.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	390	) And of course if your spouse has an STD and you have sex with your spouse, you can catch it.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	390	Nor does abstinence "provide 100% protection against STDs and pregnancy," since rape and child molestation do happen.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	390	And finally, there are a great many "questions when it comes to abortion" -- including the safety and wellbeing of the woman, the privacy of family decisions, the right to bodily autonomy, the state's interest in the life and health of its citizens, the relative value that should be placed on the life of the developing being, and the stage of development at which such value should attach or be assessed -- just to name a few off the cuff.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	391	Actually, you can contract an STD not having sex outside of marriage.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	391	Or, to avoid the double negative, having sex strictly with your spouse.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	391	It takes TWO people to make sex.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	391	So,younot having sex outside of marriage doesn't necessitate that he/she will as well.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	391	It would require both parties abstain to attain the "high sexual standards" you propose setting.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	391	What are our current sexual standards by comparison?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	391	As far as abortion goes, there are clearly differing opinions on when life begins.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	391	As such, let doctors inform the law on when defining characteristics appear, and let women make the choice on moral judgement.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	392	If you and your spouse have no STDs and you have sex with no one else how could you possible get an STD apart from a mishap at the doctors?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	392	The only safe sex is that in a monogamous marriage.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	392	there is no question to when life begins: it's life throughout.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	392	The question is what kind of life?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	392	So, if I make the choice to kill my neighbor using my own moral judgment; it's ok?
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	393	If you and your spouse have no STDs and you have sex with no one else how could you possible get an STD apart from a mishap at the doctors?

iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	393	But that's not the point.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	393	The point is people have been having sex with or without protection for hundreds of thousands of years, and they're not about to stop now no matter how hard you stuff your fingers in your ears and how loud you yell "LALALALALALA" with your eyes closed while stomping your feat and praying.
iamdavidh	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	393	keep trying though
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	My point is you're forced to rely on your spouse having been a virgin prior to marriage as well.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	And you'll really only ever be 100% sure of your own sexual history.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	So really the only safe sex is to take a vow of abstinence.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	For life.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	There is certainly question to when life begins.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	You say it's life throughout.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	What marks the beginning stage then?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	The question isnotwhat kind of life.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	What does that even mean?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	And of course it's not ok to kill your neighbor.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	Nice try.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	Your neighborisa fully grown person, and does not live inside of you for 9 months.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	Considering that a fetus lives inside you (and if brought to term must be raised by you for 18 years), you have a little more say over it's existence.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	And, to paraphrase Obama, pregnant women tend to make the best choices on whether or not they are stable enough to raise children.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	I agree that we should have better access to contraception.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	We can certainly both agree that we should minimize numbers of abortions as possible.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	And access to contraception would certainly cut down on abortions.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	Sexual education about contraception is also key.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	394	Abstinence only does not work.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	Abstinence prior to marriage (both parties) and fidelity within marriage is the safest sexual practice period.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	That's the ideal anything less than that is a degradation.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	On the beginning of life; According to the text book definition of life both the egg and sperm are alive.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	At the point of conception you have a complete DNA and a different one from both parents.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	That's an accepted scientific fact that is not in question.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	The question is what kind of life?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	cat, dog or a chicken?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	Nope, humans produce humans.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	About killing your neighbor; So long as he is not fully grown I can kill him?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	So, if it's the neighbors kid who I have been raising for the past nine months since his parents abandoned him; it's OK to kill him if I determine that I'm no longer stable enough to raise him?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	and even more so if I raised him for the last 18yrs?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	Yeah right.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	Try that in a court of law.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	Why do you think we should reduce the number of abortions?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	Is it because you know in your heart of heart that it takes the life of a human being in the early stages of development?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	We are drowning in a sea of condoms and sex ed and it has increased the rate of abortion, not decreased it.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	Abstinence has not been tried and found wanting, but found hard and left untried.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	395	Come on let's set high standards for ourselves and our kids, not low ones.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	It is a degradation to you, perhaps.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	Others believe differently.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	Why should we legislate based on your moral beliefs?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	Let's face it, unmarried people have impulses, desires, etc.  Theyaregoing to act on it.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	Wouldn't you rather they have the tools to prevent pregnancy than not have them?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	Perhaps I should have been more specific in my example.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	A baby grows inside of you.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	So technically, it is a part of you.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	A part of your body.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	You are not obliged to see it to term if you choose not to.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	This is why a ban on abortion would fail.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	We should reduce the number of abortions because it's a very heartbreaking decision for a woman to come to.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	No woman comes to it lightly.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	When someone decides to end the life inside her, it is because she knows that it is a better choice than condemning the chiild to a lifetime of unhappiness.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	Some come to it because they know they cannot overcome an addiction and thus cannot bring a healthy child to term.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	Others because they know they cannot financially support the child.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	Others because they live in abusive homes that they don't want to subject a child to.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	Whatever the reason, it's certainly not an easy choice to make.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	So providing resources for these women such as education and contraception, can make a world of difference.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	As for your last argument, what substantiates your claim?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	From the University of California study on abstinence only and comprehensive sex education:Behavior research cannot make judgments about social values, but it can evaluate the success of school-based curricula at producing tangible outcomes for young people.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	The weight of the evidence from peer-reviewed scientific journals clearly shows that some comprehensive sex education programscan reduce behavior that puts young people at riskof HIV, STIs and unintended pregnancy, and that these programsdo not promote earlier onset of sexual activityor an increased number of sexual partners among adolescents.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	By contrast, little if any credible research exists to substantiate the claims that abstinence-only programming leads to positive behavior change among youth.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	The credible research sends a clear message to policy makers: if the goal of school-based sex education is to increase positive health outcomes for youth, comprehensive (or “abstinence- plus”) sex education is the proven effective choice.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	396	Abstinence-only programming runs the serious risk of leaving young people, especially those at elevated risk, uninformed and alienated.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	It's a degradation when it deviates from the purpose for which it was designed.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	A law should be based on what is right, not personal preference.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	I would prefer adults control their desires in order that society might function at its best.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	What if my desire wasn't sexual, let's say I have a strong desire to shoot people who make me mad.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	Should I act on it?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	You will say that hurts people and sex doesn't.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	Really, check out Ted Bundy's story sometime or the thousands of others like it.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	Consider child pornography, rape etc etc.  Or maybe the sexual abuse of women doesn't bother you.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	Sex outside of it's proper context is always, in every situation, damaging and hurtful to both parties.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	And if you disagree you are numb to it's effect.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	However, if you don't have sex you don't get pregnant.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	And you can't transmit sexually transmitted diseases without sexual contact.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	It's that simple.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	About that baby, it's not a part of you.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	It has it's own unique DNA.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	It's not yours, so it's not you.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	It is a unique and separate human being that you happen to be hosting.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	That is the undisputed consensus.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	about reducing the numbers of abortions: So if I make a heartbreaking decision after a heavy consideration to start killing all homeless people because they are sad, addicted, get beat up and we as a society can't support them anymore.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	It's OK because it was a hard decision?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	Yeah right, try that defense in a court of law.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	None of those reasons you give come close to proper justification for the taking of human life.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	A pregnancy is not the kids fault, but it is the parents responsibility.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	And kids should never get the death penalty because their parents don't want to take responsibility for them.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	The right thing to do is give them to someone who will.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	Have you ever had any success with something that you decided from the start that it would never work.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	Trouble is there are more voices telling kids to have sex than not.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	Suppose it was the other way around, what do you think would happen to all these problems?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	Go away?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	No, but they might return to the levels they were at prior to the sexual revolution.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	Abstinence only worked well in this country for awhile to curb these problems.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	And perfection is never a requirement for law.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	it's meant to reduce the numbers.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	397	Slow our stampede into social anarchy if you will.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Ah, now we get to the core of your argument.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Sex is a deviation if it's not for the purpose of child-making?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	So basically, sex is not for pleasure, only for babies?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Gay sex is wrong, then?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Or sex between infertile married couples?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Laws should be based on protecting other people, not on morality.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Just like drugs, gambling, and prostitution ought to be legal, so long as those activities do not hurt others.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Your statement that "sex outside of it's proper context is always, in every situation, damaging and hurtful to both parties" is laughable.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Many people enjoy sex before marriage and find it to be an enriching part of their relationships.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Just because you don't doesn't mean they are wrong.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	What effect am I numb to?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Orgasm?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Hardly.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	"It is a uniue and separate human being that you happen to be hosting"--like a parasite?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	So you should be able to choose whether or not to play host for 9 months.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Stop trying to relate my examples to murder.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	You and I both know the distinct differences between killing a group of cells that live within you and that you are ultimately responsible for and killing an independent person.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	You claim that adoption is the "only ethical choice" for parents who are unable to care for their children, but this distinctly ignores two of the possible reasons I gave for abortion.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	1-Addictscannotbring a healthy child to term, 2-Abused women cannot hide a pregnancy and then give a child up for adoption.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	It also assumes that there would be enough of a "market" for adopted children if abortion were suddenly banned.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Rates of children being given up would sky rocket, but would rates of parents wanting to adopt also rise?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Prohibition never works.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Prohibition on alcohol didn't work.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Prohibition on marijuana is not working.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Prohibition on sex before marriage cannot and will not work.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Prohibition fails.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Period.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Nobody is "telling kids to have sex".
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	We're providing sexual education so that if they make that choice, they will be informed on how to be healthy and responsible.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	I can't believe you'd rather have them NOT be informed, on the logic that if they DON'T know how to have responsible sex that they'll simply choose not to have it.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Did you bother reading the study I linked to?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	I'll reiterate the key points of their findings.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	1-Comprehensive sex education DOES reduce rates of pregnancy and STD's, 2-Comprehensive sex education DOES NOT increase rates of teenage sexual activity, 3-Abstinence only education DOES NOT reduce rates of teenage sexual activity.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	So, basically, the findings were that people are going to have sex, and try as you might, we can't dictate YOUR morality to them.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Tricky thing about morals, they're all relative.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	If people are going to have sex, and IF abstinence only education has been proven to be ineffective at reducing rates of sex or pregnancy or STD's, then why would we continue to stick to it?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	To appease your moral beliefs?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Again, laws are not, contrary to your belief, about morals.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	They are about people.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	And so long as sex is consensual, nobody needs protecting from it.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Except perhaps you, since you so obviously find offense in the act of love.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	I suggest this.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Teach YOUR children your moral beliefs regarding sex.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	But for the sake of society, let's teach all children (including yours) what it means to be responsible with regards to sex.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Just in case they fall off the high bar you've set for them.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Wouldn't you rather they fall without HIV?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	398	Or an unwanted pregnancy?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Sex is a deviation if it's not for the purpose of child-making?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	I never said it's sole purpose was procreation.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	The core question is one of anthropology; does man have a nature and is that nature fixed?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	You would apparently say no and that man gets to define that nature.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Laws should be based on ethics, not morality.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	However if mans nature is not fixed there can't be law or morality.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Because there is no way man ought to be and no norm from which to deviate from.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Everything becomes a matter of personal preference and taste.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Everyone does what is right in their own eyes.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	That is anarchy and society crumbles.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Second paragraph: Never said there was no pleasure in it; just that their was a cost that is hidden from your eyes.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	I could never get you to drink poison if I was upfront about the effects.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	But if I kept that information from you and packaged it good enough; it wouldn't be hard Case in point; homosexuality.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	harmless?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	The average life expectancy for a gay male is 45yrs almost half of heterosexual males.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	There really needs to be more truth in advertising for the sexual revolution.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	It has brought freedom to no one; only bondage.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Third paragraph: We get back to the real question don't we?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	What is it ?  If it's not human than no justification is necessary.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	If it is human than no justification is sufficient.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	About the choice, you made it when you decided to have sex.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	That troublesome problem of procreation again.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Fourth paragraph; there is that question again; what is it?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	just a group of cells or a human being in the early stages of life.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	If it's human, it's murder.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	hence the parallel.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Fifth paragraph: The examples you give represent a very, very small percentage of abortions.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	The vast majority of abortions are preformed on healthy women and children.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	About adoption; me and my spouse are an infertile couple, we looked into adoption and guess what?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	there are long waiting list for domestic adoption simply because there are more couples than children due to the fact that over 1500 abortions are performed daily in this country.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	that's why most couples adopt from overseas.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Sixth paragraph.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	If perfection is your standard then yes prohibition doesn't work.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Prohibition does work, that's what every law is, a prohibition.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	It's sounds like you are arguing again for anarchy.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	To that I say; truth in advertising please.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Nobody is "telling kids to have sex"Really, you just substantiated my previous claim to being numb.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Sex is used to sell everything these days.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Just go through the supermarket check-out and peruse the latest magazine covers.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	If you don't know what this does to the male mind and the way it victimizes women you are numb.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	About the choice and sex ed.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	I'd rather we told the kids the true cost of premarital sex.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	instead of lie to them.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Oh yeah little Johny you can play with fire, just follow these simple steps and you'll be just fine and hey here is some firecrackers to make it more fun.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Now let me show you how to make a really cool fire using gasoline.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Come on!
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Let's help kids choose what is best for them, and it's not broken hearts, STDs, single motherhood and the whole list of other stuff that goes along with it.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	About the parallel with fire, in case you didn't know, passion burns.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	A fire not contained can destroy a whole forest.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Don't believe me.  Watch the interview Dr.  Dobson did with Ted Bundy the night before his execution.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	I'll quote it for you from memory because it's burned in there:Dr Dobson: Ted, you once were an innocent little boy.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	How did you get here?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Ted Bundy: Pornography.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	I was exposed to it as little boy and it became a passion that was never satisfied.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	The more I got the more wanted till I was killing women to get it.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Just ask any man here who is here on sexual charges and he'll tell you the same thing.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	About the study; I don't dispute it.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Of course it's failing that's my point.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	It's only logical that it would if you have a million people shouting, have sex and one small voice whispering, abstain.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	I doubt you did your homework and looked at the numbers for teen pregnancy and STDs before and after the sexual revolution.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Abstinence is fail proof.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	You may fail to abstain but if you are abstaining you will never get pregnant.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	However contraception is not so.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	You can also fail to use it but if you use it, it can fail and you will get pregnant.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	It's that simple.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Final thought; if morals are relative as you claim, why are you trying to push yours on me and why should I follow yours and not mine.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	Is it because you think there is an objective standard that people ought to follow and a way things ought to be.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	But that's just your personal preference isn't.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	If you really believed that morality was subjective you would go sit under a tree and talk to no one, but you don't.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	399	You try and persuade people that your view is the correct one, but why I ask?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	So what then, is the "the purpose for which it was designed" if not procreation?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Pleasure?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Say it's not so!
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	I would say man has a nature and that it is fixed.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	And it is for this reason that I strongly believe in not banning abortions and I strongly believe that abstinence only education should be replaced by comprehensive sexual education.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Because part of that fixed nature of man is that each of us has impulses and desires of a sexual nature.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	(And those impulses and desires are not wrong.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	) Acting upon them is not a matter of ethics or morality.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	I've never understood how sexual activity came under the morality umbrella to begin with.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	So long as it is consensual, there's no justification.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	We don't analyze other types of activity for their moral fiber.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Do we talk about the morality of football?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	The morality of swimming?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	The morality of sleeping?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Laws, as I stated earlier, should be based on the good of society, namely not causing harm to other people, while protecting each person's individual rights to do all things that do not cause harm to others.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Ethics are not fixed, else we would all have identical ethical standards.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	How do you account for the differences if there is to be but one ideal?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	LoL at the sexual revolution bringing bondage.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	How is safe sex prior to marriage harmful to both parties, though?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	If you're responsible, no transmission of STD's, no unwanted pregnancies, what is the damage you speak of?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	As for the life expectancy of a gay man, consider this: homosexuals are 26 times more likely to die from suicide and 87 times more likely to die from murder than heterosexuals.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Which says a lot about more about tolerance than it does about lifestyle.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Nonetheless, your argument is moot anyway, because homosexuals do not choose to be homosexual.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	That's not a lifestyle choice, so it cannot be right or wrong.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Would you say when you make a choice to walk barefoot you are also making the choice to host a ringworm inside of you?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	It's something that could be a consequence of that choice, but it's not a choice you've made.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	It's an effect.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Similarly, impregnation is an effect of sex.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Not a choice in and of itself.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	The choice ought to come prior to impregnation, when one can choose to prevent it through contraception.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	But sometimes it comes after.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Nonetheless, it's up to the individual to make that choice.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	The examples I gave represent the reasons abortion ought to be accessible.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	I agree that it should not be used as birth control.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	I agree that we ought to reduce the number.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	I believe comprehensive sexual education with access to contraception is the best way to achieve that.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	You seem to think that just telling them not to do it and crossing our fingers is best.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	It's just.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	jaded.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	There are about 150,000 children up for adoption per year.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	I'm not sure how many adoptive couples.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	My point is, would adoptive couples be able to keep demand up for that many unwanted children were we to abolish abortion today?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Again, let me specify.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	When I say "prohibition doesn't work" I mean prohibition of things that people recognize to be false laws.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	These would be laws regarding our bodies.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Laws that tell us how we can use them (sex) and what we can put in them (drugs) do not work.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	People recognize the invalidity of these laws because they understand their bodies are ultimately theirs to do with what they please.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Just go through the supermarket check-out and peruse the latest magazine covers.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	If you don't know what this does to the male mind and the way it victimizes women you are numb.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Holy cow you've got to be joking!
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Victimizes women?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Let me start a new debate for this alone.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Please visit it athttp://www.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	createdebate.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	com/debate/show/Do_magazines_victimize_womenI'm all for teaching kids what's best for them.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	And what's best for them are the tools to make the best decisions for themselves.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	And those decisions, like it or not, are ultimately up to them to make.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	It's naiive to believe that all it will take is a strong voice repetitively shouting the abstinence mantra in order to keep people from having premarital sex.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Abstinence is fail proof.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	You may fail to abstain but if you are abstaining you will never get pregnant.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	However contraception is not so.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	You can also fail to use it but if you use it, it can fail and you will get pregnant.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	It's that simple.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	And this is a fine way to teach sexual education.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	I'm not against an abstinent-leaning program, but one that does not promote healthy sexual habits at all is dangerous.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	We've got to take into account those who will fail to abstain.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Not doing so is heartless.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	As far as the Ted Bundy bit goes, I really see no bearing here.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	That's specifically regarding pornography, which I'd be glad to debate the merits of in another debate.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	Final thought:Morals are relative, which is all I'm trying to push on you.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	400	My only "push" is that younotpush legislation on others based solely onyourmoral beliefs.
Spoonerism	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	401	No reply!
Spoonerism	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	401	Instead I get a downvote?
Spoonerism	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	401	On a full-page essay on the topic?
Spoonerism	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	401	That's kind of, how do you say, ah-yes, bullshit.
Spoonerism	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	401	But alas.
Spoonerism	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	401	such are the ways of CreateDebate I suppose.
SMCdeBater	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	402	Christ mate, do you want a medal or something?
SMCdeBater	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	402	Don't be so dramatic over a debate, you weren't aborted and that's why you're here.
SMCdeBater	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	402	Be thankful, because all other aborted fetuses certainly cannot.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	403	Again with this "be thankful you were aborted" argument.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	403	If I was aborted it would not make one single difference.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	403	There'd be another baby.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	403	The world still exists, life goes on.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	403	This debate would still be raging and people would still be making the same arguments.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	403	Oh.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	403	but I won't be able to make MY arguments because I wouldn't be here?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	403	Big deal!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	403	Someone else would make that argument for me.  In fact, I'd be here as another person, arguing.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Well we've covered a lot of ground.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Let me see if I can tie it all together for you; knowing that there is a difference between proof and persuasion.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	What do abortion, premarital sex, homosexuality, pornography(including soft porn, the kind found in supermarket checkout lanes) and Ted Bundy all have in common?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	What is the one unifying thread that ties them all together?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	They all devalue human life by reducing it to something less than what it is.  You agree that man has a nature and it is fixed.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Therefore there is a way in which mankind ought to function.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	A deviation from that norm is therefore dehumanizing.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Let me explain.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Abortion; Renders the human a non-human and therefore it can be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Premarital sex: views other people as objects to be used for ones own personal pleasure and then discarded when no longer wanted.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Homosexuality: An expression of self love.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Using another person to express ones love of self and then discarding that person when they no longer please you.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Pornography: The portrayal of people as objects of sexual fulfillment.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	People are viewed as objects to be used for personal pleasure and then discarded when you are done with them.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Soft porn: does the same as pornography but in a more subtle form; very deceiving since it appears harmless.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Ted Bundy; Became convinced through pornography that people were something that you used to bring pleasure to yourself and then disposed of . Do you see the pattern.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	reduce the person to an object to be used, use the person and then discard them.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	At the core of everyone of these is love of self.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Use other people to get what I want and when I'm done with them I move on.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Does the idea of using people like objects bother you at all?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	It does me.  That's why I oppose all these things.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Final thoughts:football does have morality as do all sports, it's called the rules of the game.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	There's a way you play that makes it football and a way that makes it no longer football.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Pragmatism is is a poor method for law since it has no way of telling what the good is.  Also do a word study on the etymology of the word ethic and tell me what you come up with.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Because I may be mistaken but I thought ethics (ethos) were fixed standards and morality (mores)were changing standards.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Giving ones self over to passion is to be ruled by passion and no longer reason; that's bondage to be controlled by your emotions and not your mind.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	If homosexuals don't choose to be that way, why then can so many walk away from that lifestyle and never go back.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Their high suicide rate is because of people like you who tell them they can't change when they really want to.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	That leads to depression and eventually suicide.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	That's not a very loving thing to do.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	On moral relativism; if that's true then it's just your personal preference and why should I like what you do.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	About legislation: what else do you base law on other than what you believe to be right.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	But why is it OK to base them on your morals and not mine?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	I think the state should remain neutral on sex ed.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	After all it is the parents responsibility, not the states.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Because when the state does it, they are pushing their morality on others who don't agree with it and using my money to do it.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	And that is wrong.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	About Abortion legislation, which this debate is all about.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	The state has already ruled on this issue, murder is illegal and should be.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Roe vs Wade simply stripped a whole class of people protection under that law and denied them rights we all enjoy.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	So again the question on abortion is; what is it?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	If it's not human, no justification is necessary.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	If it is human than no justification is adequate.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	So I say, it ain't a chicken.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Humans produce humans.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Therefore no reason you gave for abortion is adequate.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	404	Also I like the idea of your debate; I'll be sure to weigh in on it when I get a chance.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	Abortion: Gives a mother a choice in carrying a life form for 9 months and then raising it for the rest of her life.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	Renders the human a non-human and therefore it can be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	It cannot be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	Only within a set time frame during which it has not become a person.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	Premarital sex: Sex that occurs before marriage.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	views other people as objects to be used for ones own personal pleasure and then discarded when no longer wanted.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	Generally I think of premarital sex as occurring within a relationship.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	If you're talking about casual, random sex, then your argument may hold some weight.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	But in the context of a relationship, there is a lot more at stake than personal pleasure via sex.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	Homosexuality: Sexual desire for those of the same sex.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	An expression of self love.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	Using another person to express ones love of self and then discarding that person when they no longer please you.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	Wait.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	whaT?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	Where exactly are you getting this?
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	Pornography: Sexual media that satisfies urges of those who cannot get laid as often as they'd like.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	The portrayal of people as objects of sexual fulfillment.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	People are viewed as objects to be used for personal pleasure and then discarded when you are done with them.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	Hustler is viewed as an object for personal pleasure to be discarded.

Turned to violent sexuality (more often detective books portraying sexual violence than pornography) after an inability to relate to humanity.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	I'm skipping around on your other arguments because I'm not in the mood for an essay, so bear with me. Find me the "so many" homosexuals who can walk away from the lifestyle and never go back and I'll find you a group of people who have lied to themselves to make society happy.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	Laws should be based on the good of society, not on your morals.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	About sex ed, you're naive if you think we can leave it to the hands of the parents.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	You may be a responsible parent who plans to teach your children about sex, but many are not.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	We owe a responsibility to every child to give them the tools necessary to make the right choices when the time comes.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	Whether that's abstention or contraception, only they can make that choice.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	Alas, I think I'm a little spent on this topic.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	I've had this in my argument activity for weeks but I've been reluctant to write back because it's gone all over the place.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	405	If you want to debate any of the non-abortion arguments we've been discussing, let's create a new debate, because this long argument full of fifty mini-arguments is just confusing.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	The central theme running through your response is sex; all these issues revolve around that central theme.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	The question seems to be one of teleology; what is it for, how should we use it and how do we deal with it's consequences.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	As we, as a culture, remove the boundaries of sexual conduct and blur the distinctions it begins to have serious consequences we don't immediately recognize.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	The logical out working of the sexual revolution may be missed by those who advocate for it, but it is not missed by the youth.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	They are looking to us as adults to clue them in on how the world works and we are sending them a clear message about sex.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	While we sit here and debate these issues and argue that it doesn't hurt anyone and kid ourselves into thinking we are liberating ourselves; we find our children living in fear and bondage to sexual harassment at school.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	Girls are primarily the target and their grades suffer because of it.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	The sexual revolution has liberated no one; it has only dragged thousands into bondage and slowly ate away at a once great nation.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	You need to really think hard about the ramifications of what you are arguing for.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	Because you may not see the cost but that doesn't mean there isn't one.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	If we as a nation are to avoid going the way of the Roman Empire we need to restore the boundaries of sexual conduct.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	Our streets are flooded with sexual perversion because we have removed all limitations to sexual expression.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	The last limitation that remains is "age of consent" and that is being vigorously attacked.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	The only safe place of expression for sex is within the context of a life long heterosexual marriage.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	But we have told the youth otherwise; so are we surprised by the way they conduct themselves in school among classmates of the opposite sex.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	We don't need to be telling kids to use a condom if they want to sexually express themselves.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	We should be telling them that sexual expression is only appropriate within the context of a life long heterosexual marriage.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	Are we so foolish as a people to think that this is the first time in history a people has moved in this direction?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	They indeed have and the results are always devastating.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	Why should we think they will be any different for us.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	"Those who don't know history are destined to repeat it.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	406	"-Edmund Burke (1729-1797)
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	Ok, the central theme thing is completely unfair, considering you were the one who originally argued about porn, Ted Bundy, premarital sex, and the like.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	I merely countered your argument.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	So in realityyourcentral theme seems to be sex.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	I won't disagree with your argument entirely.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	There are certainly a number of drawbacks to the sexual revolution.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	Namely in terms of the feminist revolution.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	We've taken a number of steps backwards in some inane desire to please men.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	The "playboy effect" is a very negative behavior that has resulted from the sexual revolution.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	This does not mean that the sexual revolution was all bad or that sex outside of marriage is bad.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	It's quite a jump to say that sex is only ok in a lifelong heterosexual marriage except for religious reasons.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	From a religious context, sure, it makes perfect sense, but outside of that it does not.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	For one, "lifelong" partnerships sometimes don't last a lifetime.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	For another, people are biologically programmed to sexual desires.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	Sex is a very fulfilling part of a serious, committed relationship, and I stand by my statement that there is nothing wrong with that.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	Furthermore, you entirely ignored my desire to quit debating non-abortion related issues within this debate.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	If you'd like to debate some other topic, let's start a new debate.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	407	(please and thank you)
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	OK I agree about a new debate; any ideas?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	I do think I need to clarify something however and then I'll leave it at that.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	Sex with in the context of a lifelong heterosexual marriage is the ideal and proper function of sex.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	Any form of sexuality outside of that is dysfunctional and causes problems.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	As with anything when it is not used properly.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	I raised the issues of porn, Ted Bundy, premarital sex, and the like as case studies of this principle.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	All of these are sexual expression outside of the proper context of sex and all of them cause problems; hence why I would classify them as dysfunctions.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	What does all this have to do with the abortion question?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	The fact that there is such a thing as this debate about abortion proves there is a problem.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	No problem, no debate.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	So here is the problem as I see it.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	Married couples don't have abortions.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	So who does then?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	those expressing themselves sexually outside the context of marriage.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	If this causes a problem (abortion) than we must say something is dysfunctional or unhealthy.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	We can't say it is the sexual act because that alone doesn't always cause problems.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	It has to be the context in which it occurs.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	Because sexual expression in one way is without problems and in another it causes problems.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	Or to put it another way; one is a healthy expression and the other is unhealthy.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	So to sum it all up; You will know whether something is healthy or dysfunctional by the fruit it produces.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	All the examples I gave including abortion are symptomatic (the fruit) of an underlying problem; sex outside it's proper context.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	But this does highlight a problem we in our culture suffer from.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	We have forgotten the principle of sowing and reaping.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	When you plant a tree you don't immediately get fruit, it takes time.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	So if we do something and don't immediately see bad results that doesn't mean there won't be any.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	It may take years before are actions bear fruit.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	So I hope you can see that I'm still debating the same issue.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	I'm going after the cause and not the symptom however.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	I also have been careful not to argue from religious reasons, although my convictions inform my reasons.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	So I would agree with you that people are biologically programmed to sexual desires and that sex is a very fulfilling part of a serious, committed relationship.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	But I would say, judging by the fruit, that there is a healthy and unhealthy expression of that sexuality.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	408	Maybe we could debate whether or not sex outside of marriage is unhealthy by looking at the fruit it produces.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	409	you're not arguing that abstinence doesn't provides 100% protection are you?
Prevaricate	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	410	it is 100%but that is just the first stephow does one implement abstinence upon any societyhow would you do it in Americawould yah say "just say 'no' "
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	411	You lead by setting a higher standard.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	411	That's what leaders do; take people were the don't want to go.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	411	It takes no leadership on my part to get the family to go to Disneyland.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	411	It does how ever to get them to save through out the year so at Christmas time they have something to give to those less fortunate.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	412	Actually, depending on what is allowed in "abstinence", it may not.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	412	Oral sex, for instance, can transmit STD's, and many abstinent teens turn to oral sex as a way to satisfy their sexual desires.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	412	I'm arguing that sexual desires are natural.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	412	It's easy to succumb to those desires and so abstinence-only education is weak.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	412	It ignores the fact that some people will CHOOSE not to remain abstinent.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	412	And that these people deserve facts on having safe sex.
Spoonerism	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	412	And furthermore, that if we made contraception more widely available to those who choose not to be abstinent, we can drastically cut down on the numbers of abortions.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	Abstinence means to abstain.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	You can't get pregnant if you're not having sex and STDs are called that because they are sexually transmitted; no sex, no transmission.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	About desire, we all got them and we all have an assortment of them.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	The difference between children and adults is that adults learn to control them.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	Children act on every desire; if adults did that, society would not be possible.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	So what I hear you saying is that we should never grow up.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	Hey kids will be kids, right?
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	Come on.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	Let's raise the bar and actually expect kids to grow up.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	Also, giving condoms is giving permission.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	You may be self deluded, but the kids get the message loud and clear.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	Sex outside of marriage goes through the roof with this approach and so does all the other problems associated with it.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	What I hear you saying is that it's best to create 100 problems to solve 1 problem.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	I'm sorry but that's what I call moral confusion.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	Final thought, Kids rise to the occasion when you challenge them.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	Yes, some will fail.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	But better to loose a 100 than 10000.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	And the converse is also true.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	Set a low standard and kids will meet it.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	That's because they are looking to adults for guidance.
jstantall	Spoonerism	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	413	So, lets expect more out of kids and not less.
Prevaricate	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	414	yes - i agree that abstinence is 100% absolute protection but i still await your explanation of how you would enforce such a policy
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	415	You don't nor should you.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	415	The government should remain neutral on this issue.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	415	It's the parent's responsibility, not the state's.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	415	We need to get sex ed out of public schools and give the choice of sex ed back to the parents were it belongs.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	415	And may the best idea win.
Banshee	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	416	Not if you get raped, no.
Prevaricate	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	417	attn Jstabtall:do you live in some kinda warped universe"Abstinence is the only practice that provides 100% protection against STDs and pregnancy, nothing else comes close.
Prevaricate	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	417	"can you show me a culture or a time in human history where society has instituted functional, workable, effective abstinence policyyes - your proposal works in an ideal world were everyone has exactly the same thoughts and actions but that world does NOT exist
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	418	Yes, I do.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	418	that's the problem.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	418	Why not strive for the ideal instead of settle for something less.
Prevaricate	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	419	"Over the past decade, the US federal government has heavily promoted programs that advocate sexual abstinence as the key strategy for dealing with adolescent sexuality, but studies are demonstrating that the approach has little impact on teen sexual behavior or in preventing pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)"
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	420	Guess it depends on who's study you read and how they ask the questions.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	420	The CDC tells a different story.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	420	STD means sexually transmitted and if your not having sex (any kind of sexual contact) you're not transmitting; It's that simple.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	420	Ask the CDC what they do in an outbreak, quarantine.
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	420	Why do hospitals not allow children visitors during flu season?
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	420	Why are you advised to stay at home when sick?
jstantall	Prevaricate	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	420	Please tell me why this approach works for all diseases except sexually transmitted ones?
khaOs	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	421	It makes me sick to think that there are people as thick-skulled as you.
khaOs	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	421	Living in your ideal little world with lolli-pop forests and marshmallow skies.
khaOs	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	421	Have you ever heard of RAPE, or INCEST?
khaOs	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	421	Abortion should NOT be a form of birth control, but for a victim of sexual abuse of any kind, it should at least be a final option.
jstantall	khaOs	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	422	Yeah, that makes sense.
jstantall	khaOs	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	422	Let's kill the kid for a crime they didn't commit.
jstantall	khaOs	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	422	Thanks for clearing that up for me. But please tell me why you think death is preferable to life?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	423	You're not killing a KID.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	423	I must have said this a billion times.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	423	But you're still stuck on that, so it's a shame.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	423	On the subject of why Death is preferable to Life: Because Death comes to us all.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	423	And Death is as much a part of Life as Light and Dark, or Good and Evil.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	423	Death can't be avoided.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	423	What you're talking about is a POSSIBLE contribution to society on earth if the fetus be allowed to mature into a person.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	423	But we've already argued this point of POSSIBILITY to death (excuse the pun): a fetus Could turn out to be worse than Hitler or the Devil itself.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	423	but you love talking about possibilities don't you?
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	423	You have a fixation on things that aren't real.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	423	Please read a fantasy novel, don't ban abortion.
Kuklapolitan	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	424	No, of course abortions should not be banned for you would have them anyway regardless of safety, funding or anything else that might get in the way.
Kuklapolitan	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	424	We would be back in the days of the butcher shops and that wouldn't be good for anyone.
Kuklapolitan	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	424	Abortion is not a trivial matter and is one that must be thought out thoroughly by the person or persons involved.
Kuklapolitan	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	424	I wouldn't like to see us take such a serious step lightly nor would I like to see us take a step backwards in time.
jstantall	Kuklapolitan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	425	So you would say that it is better that 45 million + children die through abortion than a handful of women through a botched abortion.
jstantall	Kuklapolitan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	425	That doesn't sound like progress to me: That sounds like serious moral confusion.
jstantall	Kuklapolitan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	425	Go check out the stats on abortion rates through out the years and you will see a staggering peak after Roe vs Wade.
jstantall	Kuklapolitan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	425	And yes, we would still have abortions, they would just be a whole lot fewer of them.
jstantall	Kuklapolitan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	425	Again, check out the stats on abortion rates before and after Roe vs Wade.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	426	45 million + children did not die, 45 million + potential children were prevented from being.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	426	That's a big difference.
NVYN	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	426	Until you can see that you will not agree with us.
kamranw	Kuklapolitan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	427	This is flawed logic.
kamranw	Kuklapolitan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	427	By your logic nothing should be illegal because people do it anyway.
kamranw	Kuklapolitan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	427	Why make cocain illegal, people do it anyway?
Kuklapolitan	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	428	I understand what you mean and perhaps I should have worded it differently but I remember the times before Roe v.  Wade where women would have abotions regardless of peril to their own lives!
Kuklapolitan	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	428	That's what I meant.
Prevaricate	Kuklapolitan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	429	interesting that in the eight years of Bush and the years of Republican controlled Congress and era of conservative judges that th 1973 Roe versus Wad has not been overturnedalthough they claim to be Christian fundamentalist, they too have a use for abortions . . .
Prevaricate	Kuklapolitan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	429	it not just Democrats that go to Planned Parenthood and private doctors for pregnancy terminations
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	430	What I don't get is people pay to kill their OWN children.
nattyc	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	430	They are paying to murder an innosent child.

DaddySays	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	431	Mwaaa ha ha ha ha haYou are retarded, I just want to throw that in.
helloim123	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	432	I feel sorry for you.

August	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	434	Hey girl you have just lost the argument, there is not evidence, no perswation in your "article".
August	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	434	all you did was attack another person's ethos.
August	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	434	I feel sorry that you have had so many abortions.
August	DaddySays	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	434	Perhaps its time to switch your birth control.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	435	They are not children, so stop victimizing the people exercising their rights to keep or not to keep a fetus.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	435	You people are exactly the reason why women suffer from depression and guilt!
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	435	I propose we outlaw the systematic bullying by pro-life people.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	435	We should treat their bullying behaviour with the same disdain and disgust we treat schoolyard bullies.
NVYN	nattyc	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	435	Leave the women alone, they have the rights to determine what's to be done to their own bodies.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	This is a speech that i found:On behalf of the Salt&Light team, I would like to speak to you about a subject that is near and dear to our hearts.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	Today is National Sanctity of Human Life day.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	Perhaps you have noticed the pro-life sign in front of our church.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	If not, I invite you to look at it after the service this morning.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	Thirty years ago, the United States Supreme Court made up a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v.  Wade.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	Since then there have been 44 million abortions.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	There have been 112 million births.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	Using those two numbers, one can calculate that 28 percent of all pregnancies have ended in abortion.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	Everyday the number of babies killed by abortionists approximately equals the 3,000 killed by terrorists on September 11, 2001.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	Now I believe that I do not have to convince anyone here in this church about the evilness and tragedy of abortion.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	But, if anyone remains unconvinced, go over to our nursery, pick up a little baby, hold it in your arms and gaze into its eyes and you will know the truth.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	All the pro-choice pro-abortion rhetoric will just melt away.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	The real question to be asked is why, in this predominately-Christian nation, do we tolerate this practice?
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	I have spent three years trying to answer that question.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	I must tell you that I am totally amazed.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	There really should be no debate at all about abortion.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	The truth should be clear to everyone.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	It should be a slam-dunk that abortion should not be tolerated.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	It should not be legalized.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	And it should not be a choice.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	After studying this issue, I now understand how Adolf Hitler was able to pull off the holocaust.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	It took a tremendous amount of propaganda, lies, and deceit.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	The Nazis were able to morally confuse many people.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	It took many good Christians in Germany closing their eyes and remaining silent.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	Well the same thing is true today in the United States of America.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	There are a relatively few passionate activists who loudly spread pro-choice pro-abortion propaganda, lies, and deceit.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	They are able to morally confuse many people in our country.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	It is a sad truth that most Christians in all denominations have closed their eyes and have remained silent.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	The abortion struggle has corrupted our politics.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	Legalized abortion is so entrenched in our government because one of our two major political parties has embraced it.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	To even be considered a viable candidate in that party one must blindly accept the doctrine of legalized abortion.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	This has made it difficult for the Christians who are traditionally members of that party.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	Every election cycle, pro-choice candidates try to give Christians reasons to vote for them on other issues.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	And so, too many Christians forget about abortion as they go vote.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	They often provide the margin of victory for pro-choice pro-abortion candidates.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	If a miracle were to happen and those Christians were to hold a little baby in their arms and gaze into his or her eyes just before stepping into the voting booth, our system of abortion would disappear after the very next election.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	In conclusion, the most important thing I have learned during these last three years is that the future of abortion is totally in the hands of Christians.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	We really do have the political power to solve this problem.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	Our cultural enemies know this and they are scared.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	They desperately work to demonize and marginalize us.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	We do not have to convince the sinful pro-choice activists that they are wrong about abortion.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	We do not have to convince the radical feminists, the biased news media, or the morally corrupt politicians.
nattymoon24	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	436	To win, all we have to do is convince our fellow Christians to truly follow Christ and there is no doubt that they will vote pro-life.

ungernick28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	439	i think it depends on the circumstances.
ungernick28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	439	if you were raped, and then got pregnant, would you still keep the child.
ungernick28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	439	Certainly it shouldn't be a form of birth control, but in some cases it should be allowed.
ungernick28	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	439	besides if your argument is that we would be taking a life then wouldn't we have to stop anything that takes a life such as war, the death penalty, and meat production?

kitkat	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	440	for women, how would you feel if you didn't want to have a child and an accident happened, with a condom or birth control or anything else.
kitkat	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	440	what if abortion was illegal?
kitkat	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	440	because procreation is such a burden on women anyway, between periods, pregnancy, and the birth, don't you think that women should at least have a choice?
kitkat	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	440	(By the way: if you want to talk about the baby being alive as it's a growing egg, well here's the thing, everything on this is formed with cells and bacteria so think about that next time you shoot a deer or something.
August	kitkat	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	441	Um.

August	kitkat	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	441	I am a girl, and a girl who knows the developement of a child.
August	kitkat	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	441	If you do not want the child give it up for adoption, there is no reason to kill it.
NVYN	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	442	Again, adoption should be a choice, not a must.
NVYN	August	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	442	It should be made available as an option.
freedomrules	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	443	Alright look no abortion isn't good,but you no what what if a 16 year old girl made a mistake and got pregnant,and she can't support the baby,so she wants to abort it,because the baby would have a bad life,she should be allowed to,yea it was her fault for being stupid but,that was what happened and in a way she would be protecting the baby.
freedomrules	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	443	Or if someone got raped and got pregnant why the hell would you make someone keep that reminder of that experience its there life let them make a choice.
freedomrules	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	443	I understand if you just keep having sex and aborting the baby then that's horrible but in certain situations sorry its necessary,and its not your life so but out.
shingitesol	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	444	Even if the law stopped the woman from aborting her fetus, I wonder whether the life of the baby would be normal and happy as the others.
shingitesol	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	444	Abortion is both for the baby and the mother.
NVYN	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	445	Before the fetus can digest milk.
NVYN	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	445	Before the time when the fetus could actually be kept alive by somebody else other than its mother and her blood.
NVYN	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	445	Nobody else should have a say but its mother.
NVYN	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	445	You can say it's a member of society, but really it is not.
NVYN	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	445	It is only the property of its mother until society can keep it alive without her.
NVYN	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	445	Society must not make laws that affect things outside of its control.
NVYN	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	445	One city should not make laws for another city.
singasong	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	446	I believe the person herself should be given a free will to decide whether to abort or not, banning abortion does not give her an option.
eilter	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	447	In our society's view today abortion is something to be outlawed.
eilter	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	447	Most of the logic behind this stems from the Bible's teachings unfortunately, leading to yet another flawed belief.
eilter	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	447	Abortion is a thing that should be upheld on a case by case basis.
eilter	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	447	You can't argue that it should be banned because the baby has feelings and such, but on the same note you can't just flat out say that Abortion is a great thing because it can help the people having the baby.
eilter	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	447	By going on a case by case basis and comparing statistics such as: age, income, education, living situations, etc. . . .
eilter	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	447	I believe the problem of abortion would be solved.
yudish9	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	448	some people have sex for leisure without the use of condom.
yudish9	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	448	The excitement are stronger than them.
yudish9	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	448	so why do they need to have a baby.
Denise360	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	449	Who has control over a pregnant womens life.
Denise360	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	449	she does because something is going good in her life and she doesn't want to mess that up by having a baby not saying having a baby is a burden (i love babies) but you can't control all of life but you can some what control what happens to you.
Animegirl300	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	450	It shouldn't be banned, but restricted to ONLY the women who really need it for something like Medical purposes.
Sweetgem973	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	451	I don't think it should be banned because like if you don't think its right - don't do the abortion.
Sweetgem973	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	451	But they're are teenager outs there who are having babies and if they continue with the 9 months its will ruin their lives.
Sweetgem973	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	451	Everyone should make their own choice to do what they want with their baby
Manastacious	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	452	Abortion is aw right that should be based solely on the woman's decision.
Manastacious	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	452	There is no reason for abortion to be banned, and in fact, that is restricting the rights of women by not allowing them to have abortions.
Manastacious	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	452	Also, think of those who have been raped and sexually abused and have no choice but to bear the child of a person who did such horrible things to them.
Manastacious	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	452	An abortion is the only way to escape raising something that would always remind that person of something horrible in their life.
kamranw	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	453	So the woman's decision means killing a child, and that should be ok? How is the fact that the child was conceived through rape, the childs fault?
kamranw	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	453	Would you treat this child different after it was born?
kamranw	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	453	So, why treat it any different before?
kamranw	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	453	Finally, abortion is NOT the only way to escape raising a child that would remind that person of something horrible.
kamranw	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	453	They can put the child up for adoption.
kamranw	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	453	There are thousands of families waiting.
Manastacious	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	454	No, wit does not mean killing a child.
Manastacious	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	454	It means killing a zygote that has no conscious thought.
Manastacious	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	454	Arguments against abortion use scare tactics like killing cute babies in their mother's arms.
Manastacious	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	454	This is not what abortion is.  Abortion is an escape route for people who have no other choice but to not have a baby.
Manastacious	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	454	You Kamranw forget the situation of the mother's death.
Manastacious	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	454	Also, yes a child that was born because of a traumatic indecent such as rape would be treated differently.
Manastacious	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	454	Also, what about the mother's career or in some cases the mother's education.
Manastacious	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	454	Should that be ruined because of the inability for this escape.
jstantall	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	455	Help me with something here, are you saying that a career and education are more important than the life of a child?
jstantall	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	455	Also, were you ever a zygote that had no conscious though?
jstantall	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	455	Than you would have to agree that if your mother had an abortion it would've killed you, not something else, but you.
jstantall	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	455	Aren't you glad your mother put your life before hers?
Manastacious	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	456	A.
Manastacious	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	456	there is no reason to bring personal things into a debateB.
Manastacious	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	456	My parents intended to have a child.
Manastacious	jstantall	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	456	Planned pregnancies are different from impregnation via traumatic experiences.
kamranw	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	457	A mothers career should be a factor in a childs life?
kamranw	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	457	And yes, it is a life.
kamranw	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	457	You were once under 10 weeks old in your mothers womb as well.
kamranw	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	457	Let me rephrase, would you justify a child being treated poorly and judged differently because their mother was raped?
helloim123	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	458	If you go to your local crisis pregnancy center and ask about adoption they will provide information and if you choose adoption they will lead you through the process.
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	459	Adoption should be a choice but not a must.
NVYN	kamranw	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	459	People should be made aware of this option and any other options available, but don't force them to take the option.
helloim123	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	460	After a woman has an abortion, her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief.
helloim123	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	460	Then, with repression and denial, she avoids the problem, usually for years —5 years is common, 10 or 20 not unusual.
helloim123	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	460	Guilt, regret, remorse, shame, lowered self-esteem, dreams and nightmares, flash-backs, anniversary reactions, hostility toward men, crying, despair, and even suicide attempts are symptoms of Post-Abortion Syndrome.
helloim123	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	460	Many women turn to drugs and alcohol as a way of masking the pain.
helloim123	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	460	Anniversary reactions are an increase in symptoms around the time of the anniversary of the abortion, the due date of the aborted child, or both.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	461	A woman's emotional problems post-abortion may well be brought about and exacerbated by pro-life harrassments.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	461	A woman going through any emotional difficulties should be supported by the community and/or her family and close friends.
khaOs	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	462	No, no, no, NO!  Abortion should NOT be just another form of birth control.
khaOs	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	462	It should ONLY be allowed for victims of rape and sexual abuse that results in pregnancy, and ONLY as a last resort.
helloim123	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	463	Again I must say that only 1% of all abortions are performed because the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.
helloim123	Manastacious	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	463	Women rarely become pregnant if they are raped.
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	464	If the statistics are so low, why then should we make it illegal?
NVYN	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	464	Is this an argument for or against choice?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	465	The point is that abortions haven't got a feasable reason to exist.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	465	Accidents happen, so don't sweep the mistake into the gutter and try 10 years later.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	465	I mean, sure, we ca kill a fetus for a crime that it didn't commit, but that's a lame excuse.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	466	If abortions haven't got a feasible reason to exist then why do they happen?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	466	Do you think it's a fun past-time for the people who have to go through it?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	466	Oh, we're bored so let's go and get an abortion for shits and giggles?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	466	Abortions DO have really good reasons to exist, that is why they continue to exist, you just haven't opened your mind to our side of the issue.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	466	But that's ok, cos we're not interested in forcing you to do what we do, stop trying to force us.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	466	About killing a fetus, I know this may sound a little heartless to you but I'd still like to see you argue this properly: Why shouldn't we kill fetuses?
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	466	We can make fetuses all the time (some people can't but this doesn't concern them), the human population in the world continue to grow and if overpopulated, we'd be in crisis mode because of food shortages and environmental destruction.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	466	We don't owe fetuses anything!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	466	If we want to have kids and give them a chance to contribute to society as well as carry on our genetic heritage then we can keep the fetuses, but if we don't want kids, we can just get rid of the fetuses, we don't need to consider if the fetuses have committed a crime or not, we don't need any excuse at all.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	466	Hell, they can't commit crimes.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	Fine, you want validation?
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	That's all you'll get.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	Don't ask for anything else.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	Starting off, the 9 month waiting period of childbirth cannot be justified to my point of view, I'll admit that right now, because clearly one woman vs millions of others doesn't tip the scales towards my side of the argument.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	Unfortunately, there isn't a lot I can say otherwise without coming across as biased, as you believe I have for the past 10 arguments or so.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	I suppose, since we're already there, I'll state openly that a fetus doesn't have to look like a mistake.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	Not much can be helped for those that are being aborted right now, but that doesn't mean that we can't change anything for the future.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	A fetus is a cluster of cells that is parasitic, according to your side of the argument, and it is potential and genetic human life according to my side.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	What you need to understand is that we both look at a human fetus in twoverydifferent ways, and neither one of us is going to change the other's point of view.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	An example of this has already been discussed and is as follows: You told several others as well as myself that the fact that any fetus is apotentialdoesn't help our side of the argument.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	I disagree in more one way, by firstly saying that we cannot make an immediate decision as to whether or not the child has an 80, 60, 40, 20 or even a 0% chance to live.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	It is potential because itcanexist, and no amount of whining will prove otherwise.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	"A fetus commits no crimes because it can't even process anything through that embryonic structure except for required nutrients and other living needs;" this argument goes both ways.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	On your side it is inhuman, and therefore makes no difference whether or not we kill it.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	On ours, it may commit crimes in future, or it may not.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	Hell, it could cure the greatest disease for all we know!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	But hey!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	That's it isn't it!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	We can't know, and we won't know!
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	Look, I can sit here all day and argue the potentials, but as I have already said, it isn't convincing you, as you are fixed to believe that forcing your belief of punishment for unprotected sex is actually going to send the right kind of message.
SMCdeBater	NVYN	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	467	I disagree, and will happily do nothing more to change what you think.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	468	I made 2 very clear points for you to argue, but again you've gone and taken the scenic route all over the countryside, what's more, you've actually missed the 2 sights you were supposed to visit, here I'll number for you so you won't miss them:1 - Abortions have good reasons to exist, that's why they exist.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	468	2 - We can remove fetuses if we want and we don't need any excuses.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	468	It's not the same as killing people.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	468	We're not in shortage of fetuses in the world.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	468	Now, focus!
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	468	Don't go past "Go" nor collect $200 dollars (referencing the family game Monopoly) until you've talked about these 2 points.
NVYN	SMCdeBater	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	468	Then if you want to make another point, do so in a different post.
jtopolnak	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	469	As much as I'm against it and think what a horrible feeling and decision that must be for the women, abortion should not be banned altogether.
jtopolnak	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	469	We would go back to the dark ages where doctors and their patients would have "back alley abortions".
jtopolnak	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	469	3rd trimester should be illegal that's just wrong.
jtopolnak	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	469	It is a very hard topic that I struggle with.
jtopolnak	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	469	Ultimately the choice lies within the women.
jtopolnak	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	469	But what a awful one to make, they will live with it for the rest of their life.
YoungSkeptic	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	470	Abortion should not be banned.
YoungSkeptic	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	470	Pregnant women would still find a way to abort children, and thereby risk dangerous methods, or suspect "doctors", as seen in other countries.
YoungSkeptic	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	470	Freedom entitles you to do whatever you want with your body, and by that I mean until a new human is complete.
khfan22	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	471	if it was:rape--abortion should be allowed.
khfan22	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	471	consentual--abortion should not be allowed.
khfan22	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	471	you knew what the consequences of your actions would be, now you have to accept it.
khfan22	-	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	471	The only exception would be if the pregnancy could endanger the health of the mother.
helloim123	khfan22	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	472	Only 1% of all abortions in the United States are a result of rape or incest.
nattymoon24	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	473	Even if you were raped it still the killing of a living human being.
nattymoon24	helloim123	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	473	still wrong.
NVYN	nattymoon24	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	474	The fetus before week 20 in its development is not yet a life capable of survival outside the womb, it's only a potential and like any other potential life, it should not be treated like a person.
NVYN	khfan22	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	475	"you knew the consequences of your actions, now you have to live with it".
NVYN	khfan22	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	475	by this logic, you'd have no second chances in life if you ever made a mistake?
NVYN	khfan22	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	475	This is both a cruel and inflexible attitude to have in any society.
khaOs	khfan22	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	476	YES!
khaOs	khfan22	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	476	EXACTLY!
khaOs	khfan22	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	476	THANK YOU!
khaOs	khfan22	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	476	Victims of sexual crimes which result in unwanted pregnancy should be afforded the option to abort, but only as a FINAL solution.
khaOs	khfan22	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	476	And the only other exception would be when birth endangers the life of the mother, but of course, THAT decision would be left to the woman whose life is in danger.
khaOs	khfan22	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	476	Abortion shouldn't be a form of birth control.
khaOs	khfan22	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	476	My thoughts exactly.
khaOs	khfan22	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/should_abortion_be_banned	476	Thank you!

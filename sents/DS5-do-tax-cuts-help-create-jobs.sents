rahl	jorbaud	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	10	taxes are the lowest they've been in 60 years, and unemployment is still over 9%.so much for that argument.

Badmutha	speedingtime	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	12	Well it was laughable when you posted McCamnesty (d)......but hilarious when you cited Krugman......much like our economic illiterate President......Krugman has never ran anything....and wouldnt have the slightest clue what tax cuts do for people that actually create the jobs.....

rahl	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	15	reality disagrees.
rahl	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	15	personal income tax rates have no relevance or effect what so ever to a businesses hiring practices.

RPA1	Borat	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	21	Isn't it about time to cut the government death-grip on our hard-earned money?
RPA1	Borat	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	21	They have made a complete mess of it.
Badmutha	speedingtime	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	22	To argue tax cuts do not benefit job creation......is to argue tax hikes are not a detrement to job creation....which is just as insane.
Badmutha	speedingtime	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	22	I mean seriously, do you really need Krugman, or Reich, or anyone to help you figure this out on your own.A Pay Raise to every Employer, Job Creator, Entreprenuer, Producer, and Worker in this country..............how can anyone besides Stevie Wonder not see the economic benefits.........

Badmutha	rahl	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	24	Thats 100% Contradiction.......&quot;no relevance or effect what so ever&quot;....&quot;only demand has any effect&quot;.......Well doesnt a consumer with MORE MONEY typically yield MORE DEMAND?Your living in a different reality............
Badmutha	speedingtime	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	25	Do you believe economic growth yields an increase in revenues?Do you believe tax cuts yield economic growth?Case closed............
Badmutha	Borat	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	26	Well considering they pay a lion's share of the taxes.......
Badmutha	Borat	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	26	Right because rich people never buy anything......they live in holes and eat cans of tuna fish.

RPA1	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	28	In fact, more and more the 'workplace' is in cyber-space.
RPA1	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	28	I worked for a large corporation (was an employee) for 3 years right from my own home-office.
RPA1	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	28	3 decades is not an adequate statistical platform from which to draw such conclusions about global economic trends.
RPA1	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	28	Many of those other 'many people' have been mandated by useless government mandates and intrusion where they really don't belong.
RPA1	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	28	Example: 50 years ago a contractor did not have to pay for an 'environmental impact study' before building.
RPA1	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	28	Government intrusion creates this type of thing because it knows nothing about efficiency...In fact any efficient government entity will cease to exist because they would have no need.
RPA1	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	28	In government, the more needy, the more $$$$.

RPA1	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	28	An excellent reason to kick government out of the economy.
RPA1	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	28	The only reason an industry makes 'cuts' is because they are failing to make an adequate profit.
RPA1	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	28	This can be caused by many factors, most prevalent is government meddling/control.
RPA1	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	28	Not sure what you mean by 'take a pinch'
RPA1	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	28	The 'globe' uses US treasuries as their monetary standard and has been doing so for many decades.
RPA1	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	28	America is the global market.
RPA1	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	28	That is why this 'debt ceiling' controversy is worrisome to them.
RPA1	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	28	With the advent of the Internet, many businesses are global now.
RPA1	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	28	I see no threat there it's just a different market.
Badmutha	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	29	Right because Employers with MORE MONEY and Consumers with MORE MONEY and Producers with MORE MONEY only helped create jobs during the days of the caveman (liberalis democratis).
Badmutha	Clint Torres	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	29	Yes of course.....those (*)(*)(*)(*) corporations and their efficiency.
Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	30	What does that have to do with the discussion on taxes and job creation?
Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	30	If we were discussing the fairness of taxation this would have been a good (albeit not necessarily completely valid) point.
Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	30	In the context of this debate the point is totally irrelevant though.
Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	30	Rich people buy a lot of things but as tax cuts are not part of their disposable income their buying patterns are not changing (or barely changing) due to tax rate changes.
Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	30	They therefore don't create additional demand and don't stimulate the economy.
Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	30	Tax cuts by and large don't stimulate the growth of their businesses either as it's driven by additional demand, not additional cash on hand.
Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	30	And your sarcasm regarding the money under their mattresses notwithstanding, the correct financial term is &quot;money on the sidelines&quot; and it does happen a lot.
Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	30	That would be a valid argument if the cost of labor was comparable.
Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	30	In the real world no amount of taxes will make up the difference between a $5 day chinese worker and $30 hour american one, between $15,000 a year Indian engineer and $70,000-$130,000 american counterpart.
Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	30	PS and as I said in my previous post the government could have spent all this lost revenue in the US, building roads, hiring contractors, initiating science projects, investing in infrastructure and health care.
Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	30	That would have guaranteed that the money is spent in the country, created a ton of jobs and stimulated the economy.

rahl	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	34	Once again, reality disagrees with you
rahl	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	35	Again, reality disagrees.
rahl	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	35	Taxes are the lowest they've been in 60 years.
rahl	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	35	Yet unemployment is over 9%
TheTaoOfBill	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	36	Not always.
TheTaoOfBill	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	36	If said consumer already had plenty of capital demand doesn't really change.

TheTaoOfBill	jorbaud	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	41	Again this only works if the people you are giving tax cuts too are in need of extra capital.
TheTaoOfBill	jorbaud	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	41	Otherwise it gets put into a savings account.
TheTaoOfBill	jorbaud	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	41	Where it flows to other areas of the economy MUCH slower.
TheTaoOfBill	jorbaud	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	41	There are better ways to spend that money than on a tax cut.
TheTaoOfBill	jorbaud	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	41	Ways that would cause that money to flow to the pockets of business owners MUCH faster.
TheTaoOfBill	jorbaud	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	41	Like giving that money to the poor in the form of food stamps.
TheTaoOfBill	jorbaud	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	41	Food stamps is one of the best economic stimulus we have.
TheTaoOfBill	jorbaud	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	41	And it's nice because it automatically kicks in every recession.
Buzz62	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	42	There would be a small but positive hit.A bigger hit would be to spend money on infrastructure.That way...allot of unemployed become employed, they pay taxes, have income thus are spending, and with the added spending comes increased demand, thus more private sector jobs.THIS method has been tried and it worked...unlike that &quot;Trickle-Down&quot; BS...
TheTaoOfBill	Buzz62	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	43	Exactly.
TheTaoOfBill	Buzz62	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	43	It's not that tax cuts don't provide any stimulus.
TheTaoOfBill	Buzz62	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	43	It's that for the cost there are much faster and more stable ways to stimulate.
TheTaoOfBill	Buzz62	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	43	Especially when taxes are already as low as they are.
TheTaoOfBill	Buzz62	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	43	The only reason tax cuts are so popular is for selfish reasons.
TheTaoOfBill	Buzz62	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	43	It puts more money in your pocket.
TheTaoOfBill	Buzz62	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	43	So people vote for it.
TheTaoOfBill	Buzz62	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	43	But as far as economic stimulus goes it's probably the weakest method of stimulus.
TheTaoOfBill	Buzz62	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	43	The Bush tax cuts for example cost more than they put into the economy.
Iriemon	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	44	Isn't this like the 3rd or 4th recent thread with these same charts?Unemployment with Bush tax cuts:Unemployment with Clinton tax increase:Number employed with Bush tax cuts:Number employed with Clinton tax increase:To believe tax cuts spur job growth.........is to ignore common sense and every economic reality in world history.
Badmutha	Borat	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	46	It is your totally irrelevant point.....you brought it up.Surprise.....Bill Gates pays a lot more taxes than you.....and therefore gets a bigger tax cut.
Badmutha	Borat	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	46	HAVE YOU EVER RAN A BUSINESS?Then perhaps its time to let your mouth do some of the talking.......Speaking on behalf of all business owners in this country......I tend to hire people and expand my business when I have MORE MONEY.....and when my customers have MORE MONEY.

Badmutha	rahl	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	48	Lets raise taxes to 90% on employers........that should work huh?....

Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	71	Are you seriously trying to convince us that you are running a profitable business, that you can't produce whatever it is you produce fast enough, your employees are not (barely) able to cope with this demand, your products/services are selling like hotcakes and you have a waiting list of people desiring more of whatever it is you do...and despite all that because of a few percentage points of tax rates you can't afford to hire additional help?LOL, who are you kidding, yourself or the rest of us?
Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	71	If your business does not need more help you will just pocket that tax cut you are so obsessed about, if your business is profitable and hot and the market can't have enough of your product I bet you can find an easy way to finance its expansion, especially with current record low interest rates.

Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	73	LOL, you are not speaking on behalf of every employer.
Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	73	Sure does, if the money is used to create more demand for your goods and services - you will expand and you will hire.
Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	73	If there is no increased demand for your goods and services you will not hire a single extra temp even if your tax rate is below zero.

Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	76	We are talking job creation and the government taking a little extra money from the rich is the best, most reliable and efficient way to create additional demand for goods and services, stimulate the economy and job growth.

Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	83	It's a matter of balance, when demand is weak and the country is about to plunge into recession the best way to stimulate the economy is government spending and the best way to finance it is by taxing the rich which will take the money from the sidelines and put it back into circulation.PS by your logic 0% taxation will create enormous employment growth.
Borat	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	83	Of course GE does not pay taxes and still its work force does not grow exponentially (if at all) somehow.

TheTaoOfBill	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	99	Because right now you're getting tossed around by amateurs such as myself.Food stamps and welfare are meant as crutches and are not at all intended for economic growth.
TheTaoOfBill	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	99	They are there to prevent total economic collapse and help ease our way through recessions.
TheTaoOfBill	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	99	The goal is only getting those who need food stamps on food stamps.
TheTaoOfBill	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	99	If people who don't need food stamps are on food stamps it has reverse economic effects.
TheTaoOfBill	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	99	But if people who do need it are on it it creates demand and encourages much needed money flow in recessions where everyone is penny pinching.

Borat	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	141	Unfortunately the rest did not work either as a very small fraction of the package was geared towards job creation.
Borat	RPA1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	141	I never claimed that any arbitrary government spending would create jobs.

Iriemon	wayers	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	195	Ford didn't build the first car.
Iriemon	wayers	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	195	But there could be demand for a service or product that is not invented.
Iriemon	wayers	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	195	There would be demand for a reasonably priced Star Trek transporter.
Iriemon	wayers	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	195	You just need to build one.
Iriemon	wayers	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	195	There is demand for better, more efficient, less expensive.
Iriemon	wayers	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	195	But without demand for a product or service, businesses aren't going to produce it.
Iriemon	wayers	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	195	How many businesses do you see producing 8 track machines these days?
Iriemon	wayers	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	195	Why not?
Iriemon	wayers	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	195	No one wants them anymore.
Iriemon	wayers	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	195	No demand.And on a macroeconomic scale, if there is less demand because spending is down because folks are worried about their jobs or paying down debt, businesses aren't going to produce.
Badmutha	rahl	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	197	New Ideas, products, goods, and services are created....period......via the will and whim of the Entreprenuer.....regardless of DEMAND.Those Pelosi Economic Courses arent paying off for you...........
Iriemon	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	198	Sure.
Iriemon	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	198	And 99% go nowhere because there is no demand for the product created.But car makers aren't going to make more cars if there is no demand for cars.
Badmutha	politicalcenter	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	199	Well it is a BUSINESS....not a CHARITY.Should it be the goal of a business to be LESS PRODUCTIVE?Should it be the goal of a business to hire 5 Liberal slobs to do 1 Job?Efficiency is not a problem..........

politicalcenter	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	200	New equipment can then be written off as it depreciates.Tax cuts can also be used to make it easier to move companies overseas...well at least more affordable.

Badmutha	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	202	80% of Jobs are created by small businesses.
Badmutha	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	202	Its this continuing process......the will and whim of the entreprenuer that creates Jobs.Demand only determines Longevity of a business......but thats well after the initial job creation took place.
Badmutha	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	202	Well if the car makers and their consumers have additional money in their pocket (Hello Tax Cuts)..........Im betting the chances for buying more cars improves greatly.....
Iriemon	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	203	So your point is we need more failed businesses that are making products no one will buy?
Iriemon	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	203	And there in lies the problem.Tax cuts mostly benefit the rich who already have money they are sitting on.
Iriemon	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	203	Plus they make deficits worse.
Iriemon	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	203	Can't go down that road any more.Slash spending and put another million or two people on the unemployment rolls and what happens to demand for cars?

Badmutha	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	205	And the Democrat Party has been killing will and whim for the last 50 years.....

rahl	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	207	then why is unemployment over 9%?

Iriemon	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	220	Tens of millions more only saved a relatively small amount.Bush cut estate taxes, investment taxes, capital gains taxes, housing taxes, every kind of tax that enrich the rich.For the FICA taxes the working poor pay, he cut not one dime.For those who had any doubt as to the intent of the Republicans in their tax cuts.
DivineComedy	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	222	Cutting FICA taxes is impossible without cuts in benefits, and that defeats the purpose.
DivineComedy	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	222	And those bright bulbs who say people should be able to pass on their benefits to whoever they choose, are retards (or lying scum), do not know how to look the word &quot;insurance&quot; up in the dictionary or would be capable of understanding how insurance works; enough people must die without collecting for insurance to work.
Iriemon	DivineComedy	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	223	That is not true at all.For decades, the FICA taxes -- the taxes the working poorer pay, were scores or hundreds of billions more than were necessary to pay the benefits.
Iriemon	DivineComedy	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	223	Those surplus taxes were used to partially finance income and estate and investment and other tax cuts.The Republicans could have just as easily cut these surplus FICA taxes the working poorer pay, instead of cutting the taxes that mostly benefit the wealthier.But that is not what they are about.

Iriemon	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	230	Tens of millions of workers didn't, refering to the tax cut we're talking about.

DivineComedy	Badmutha	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/200296-do-tax-cuts-help-create-jobs.html	243	Raising SOME taxes may be necessary to get out of this mess of debt and deficit, keeping some regulations and safety nets may be necessary to keep a healthy workforce and compensate workers that otherwise would fairly sue a business owner into oblivion without &quot;tort reform&quot;; what is done does not have to destroy American jobs and American businesses, but what is being supported on all fronts is. Those Republicans in the debate who all raised their hands against raising taxes have locked themselves into &quot;read my lips,&quot; and whether it was the Tea Party influence or stupidity it does not matter in the long run.

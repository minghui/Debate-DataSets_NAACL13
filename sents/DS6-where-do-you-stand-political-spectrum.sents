Lackluster	CptnRodent	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	4	Especially among those for whom multiculturalism has replaced liberalism as the centerpiece for their ideology, the actual views of many on the left can be quite illiberal.
Lackluster	CptnRodent	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	4	In any case, I assigned myself the notation &quot;liberal centrist&quot;, but that is only by 2008 standards.

White Fox	Tuesday	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	59	First, he stated the fundamental premise of the left, that most people are basically good.Then, he says that that can't be true, thereby proving the right wing's point.And it's all because he thinks that right wingers are evil, though he pretty much proved their point.
White Fox	Tuesday	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	59	It's just so funny
White Fox	Skinny.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	61	The left is too focused on eliminating all traces of sexism (including biological sexism), while the right is focused on natural rights.
White Fox	Skinny.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	61	It makes sense to me why the lines are drawn like that, though the fanati-Christians sometimes make it hard to see.

jp_hart	Tuesday	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	66	Hey now, just because I like the Pogues doesn't mean I have to be immoral.
White Fox	jp_hart	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	67	But is forcing morality moral?
SpankyTheWhale	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	68	Of course it is. It is even better when you force it with a boom-stick in your hands.
jp_hart	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	70	Ummmmm, I'll go with a no for now, but I'll get back to you when I think of a way to argue that it is.
jp_hart	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	72	I just went back and looked at your results, and I found out that I'm even closer to the bottom where it says Libertarian than you are.
jp_hart	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	72	Of course I'm on the left and you're the right, but I wonder what I said that made me end up closer.
White Fox	jp_hart	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	73	The political compass 4 way political indicator isn't a perfect test.
White Fox	jp_hart	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	73	A true political spectrum is more like a line, but deviation from the line occurs with hypocrisy and short-sighted thinking.
White Fox	jp_hart	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	73	For example, one would have a hard time getting a result on some places of that chart while still having cohesive and non-contradictorial political views.
White Fox	jp_hart	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	73	In addition to that, the way that the political compass measures libertarianism is on a purely social scale, which is not accurate in itself.
White Fox	jp_hart	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	73	I'm not pure libertarian, put I'm almost as close as one gets.
TheChief	jp_hart	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	74	Honestly i don't find that test to be very accurate.
TheChief	jp_hart	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	74	White Fox is one of the biggest libertarians here.

jp_hart	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	75	I don't take offense, even though in several threads I have argued in favor of gun rights.
jp_hart	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	75	I want restrictions on their sales, but I wouldn't take them away.

JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	98	I think people really miss where Clinton actually went wrong from a liberal-centrist position.While NAFTA was certainly part of his DLC BS shift-to-the-right policy, in itself it wasn't as harmful as it is trumped up to be.Clinton's big error IMO was to make tax increases that favored the super-rich and most harshly hit upper middle class people in the professional classes (usually a swing vote... now staunch Republicans).
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	98	When FDR made a high, high upper bracket tax, he aimed directly at the super-rich... as he should have.Clinton, in accordance with the DLC philosophy, kissed up to the investor class and treated them the same as the kinda-rich... despite the fact that income is the least of their differences.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	98	As a result the professionals were hit with higher effective tax rates than the super-rich.Hitting the super-rich with precision would require at the very least a simplification of the tax code, but likely also such taboo ideas as a wealth tax (as low as 1% with a 1 million dollar exemption would make a huge difference in revenues without heavily hitting anyone).
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	98	But no the New Democrats are attempting to gain the support of the super-rich to offset the loss of the working class over social issues.
&lt;Kt&gt;	CptnRodent	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	99	You do realize that that perception of people's &quot;spectrum&quot; is hopelessly limited?I am something of a &quot;Leftist&quot; Libertarian, and NOT a centrist!

JavaBlack	legojenn	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	106	Probably different groups.In the US, &quot;New Democrats&quot; are the Democratic Leadership Council, a bloc of elitist Democrats personified by Bill Clinton, whose primary goal was to strengthen the base of the DemocraticParty by becoming more &quot;centrist&quot;.Essentially what they did was accept the negative frame given by the GOP, move the party right, diminish any reasons why ordinary people would back the Democrats, and give the Democrats a reputation as poll-followers without any core principles.Pretty dumb strategy.

presluc	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	107	When you question the &quot;leadership&quot; of the Democrtic party, I have to ask some questions.If the Republican party had control of Congress, administration and the presidency for 6 years what was acomplished?In 1999 America had a surplus today America is 3 trillion dollars in debt and counting.On 9/12 America had most of the countries of the world ready to stand with America,where does America stand today?Now you could say that the Democrats were just lucky in 1999 or you could say that it was just bad luck the Republicans went to war with Iraq.Even if that's true I could say this is a cold deck time to change the cards.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	108	Oh I agree.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	108	The DLC is, in fact, largely a response to the leadership style of RNC leaders.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	108	And SCOTUS justices and foreign policy are enough to make me a solid Crat this year... and I don't normally vote Republican even when I'm not voting Crat.But I think it's important that we in the party work to bring the leadership back down where it belongs.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	108	I have some hopes Obama could be helpful in that... but a part of me wonders if the DLC is just grooming him to be their new tool.We'll find out in 2009 I guess.
presluc	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	111	In my opinion no person should be a lockstep party member no matter what political party they belong to.As individual's Americans should point out the party leaders faults not cover it up.

TM2	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	119	But fair trade that helps to develope and protect third world nations.You can be something of a socialist without a rejection of trade as such.
TM2	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	119	And that what i am.
TM2	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	119	Thank you for making my position much more clear even if that wasnt your intention For instance in general i am a supporter of the WTO though i do believe it has significant shortcomings.
presluc	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	120	Well, that's what I like about the Democtratic party your own beleifs is not questioned in most cases respected,Example I'm pro-choice you're pro-life but I'd be willing to bet you're not a McCain supporter.lol

JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	135	I used to consider myself a &quot;liberal independent&quot;.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	135	But let's face it.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	135	I never vote Republican except in local elections (where they are often my only choice... and I pick the most liberal RINO).
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	135	And if I vote LP or GP, it's usually a protest vote.I still see more in common with the Crats than the Greens or the Libertarians, despite their flaws.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	135	I'm in the cushy middle class these days, but I used to be in the working poor.I sometimes look down on certain protectionist ideas and believe in greatly reforming many social programs... but I am absolutely appalled by the &quot;Let them eat cake&quot; and &quot;Taxation is theft&quot; blocs of the right-wing.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	135	On the rare occasions I agre with them it is for totally different reasoning.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	135	I tend to believe the claims of job loss by outsourcing are exagerrated.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	135	It's mostly a shift in jobs.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	135	I think protectionism can hold us down, but the &quot;Let them eat cake&quot; philosophy is even worse.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	135	We need a stronger safety net for workers and ways to help them retrain and relocate.As for trade I hate the fact that &quot;free trade&quot; when taken to its extreme creates a race-to-the-bottom and exploits third world cheap labor.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	135	The excuse is that the third world laborers are better off than they were, but it also places a cap on them by making the corporations dependent on that cheap labor and failing to create more skilled-labor markets for those countries- essentially specializing them as low-skill low-class markets.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	135	What's even worse is when the companies get cozy with corrupt and dictatorial governments.Eventually this usually leads to messy revolutions... much like what happened in Cuba (Marx was pro-free trade for exactly this reason).And at the same time... this does drive down wages and benefits for our low-skilled workers.My other problem is that the government excuse for &quot;free trade&quot; is that corporations will just leave...
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	135	This is essentially saying that corporations have more power than governments and can do anything.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	135	Our world, in this paradigm, is run entirely on stock prices.So my main thought is to at least set minimal standards for any US company in worker's rights that they must follow in other countries... and to make the kind of cozy banana-republic-type partnerships with evil governments punishable as crimes against humanity.Meanwhile we should denouncecountries that outsource with substandard labor regulation and sanction countries that allow corporations to get cozy, corrupt relationships with dictators.If human rights and quality of life move up around the world (as opposed to getting raised to low-skill specialization and capped there), it's better for all of us.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	135	We cannot stop globalization and shouldn't... but we must ensure that it works for the rise of all humanity and not simply the wealth of stockholders or the power of corporate executives.
JavaBlack	presluc	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	135	Well the words &quot;free&quot; and &quot;fair&quot; usually set off my BS sensors immediately when placed in policy slogans.

Kazikli Bey	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	149	Basically, they believe that any government intervention is fascism.
SpankyTheWhale	Kazikli Bey	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	150	There is a difference between a wrong and unwarranted action that didn't even serve the purpose it was intended for and fascism.
Kazikli Bey	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	151	So then you feel Roosevelt's actions were necessary and alleviated the Depression, not prolonged it?
White Fox	Kazikli Bey	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	152	Not quite.
White Fox	Kazikli Bey	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	152	Libertarians believe that the certain amount of government regulation which is optimum for society is an amount much smaller than what we have today.
White Fox	Kazikli Bey	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	152	That's a broad definition, but the word libertarian applies to a broad range of people.
SpankyTheWhale	Kazikli Bey	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	153	FDR's intervention, coupled with the onset of World War II, did work.
SpankyTheWhale	Kazikli Bey	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	153	I don't know if it was &quot;necessary,&quot; but it was effective.
SpankyTheWhale	Kazikli Bey	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	153	However, his intervention set a precedent from which government grew to rationalize ever further interventions, mostly unnecessary and ineffective (and often counterintuitive), into the lives of the people.
SpankyTheWhale	Kazikli Bey	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	153	JFK sealed the precedent by prolonging the welfare state.
Kazikli Bey	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	154	I know, but that tends to be the impression i get from the ideologue libertarians.
Kazikli Bey	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	154	I know quite well that Libertarians are a group of people who believe that the Constitution is the be all and end all to the American system (though, i have to say, when FDR came to power, people weren't asking him to violate the Constitution, just interpret it differently, well, that is at least what my history lecturer told me anyway).
Kazikli Bey	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	155	But that was in an age where the centralisation of power was a growing trend.
Kazikli Bey	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	155	Most governments in Western countries in that time period grew in power and responsibility.
Kazikli Bey	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	155	I think that it is an inherent part of a democracy to be not only adaptive, but to follow trends towards centralisation as time progresses.
Skinny.	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	157	Libertarians basically want state intervention in our lives to remain minimal, and only when necessary.
Skinny.	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	157	One of the main pillars libertarianism is based on, is that we should be able to do whatever we want, so long as we don't infringe on other's rights.
Skinny.	Kazikli Bey	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	157	Well, it's not so mcuh any constitutuion itself, just right to property, right to life and freedom of choice.
Caltex	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	159	Libertarianism could be broken down like this:Economic policy would be low taxes, and as little government intervention as possible.
Caltex	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	159	Free markets.Social policy would be as much freedom as possible for the people, only limiting that freedom in that they do not infringe on the rights of others.Military policy tends to vary, but usually have the mind set &quot;If they leave us alone, we'll leave them alone&quot;.
CB4	Caltex	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	160	interesting and what about social programs?
SpankyTheWhale	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	161	The government should not take part in social programming.
SpankyTheWhale	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	161	The power of the free market, with the help of private, freely donated charity, will take care of it.
CB4	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	162	hmm im liking the sound of these libertarians.im all for minimal gov intervention, free markets enterprise, no social programs, and human beings freedoms above all
JavaBlack	CB4	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	163	I'm for peace, freedom, human rights, and cherry pies for all!That doesn't necessarily mean that I can come up with an ideology that actually makes it a reality.I think libertarianism suffers the same problem.
SpankyTheWhale	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	164	Perfect libertarianism (obviously) is impossible, but I think it is a valid point that movements toward libertarianism tend to increase happiness and prosperity, while movements away from it tend to decrease both.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	165	It depends on where we currently are and on the conditions surrounding us.If security (of any kind) is put in jeopardy, especially in a turbulent time, it does not increase happiness.And if happiness.prosperity only increases for part of the population while it decreases for another, it's hard to see how that is valid.Are you actually going to suggest that people were happier and more prosperous during the robber baron days than today?
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	165	What drives me mad about libertarians is that they simply assume the free market will solve all the problems and create opportunity for all.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	165	If it doesn't... oh well.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	165	It's not like libertarians are ever part of the groups that suffer.
SpankyTheWhale	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	166	When you say it that way...
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	167	Does it matter how you say it?People were either happier back then or they were not.It strikes me that libertarians are more concerned with the ceiling for happiness to be infinite (while I don't actually think happiness works in that way... but oh well) even if that means a majority of the population will be miserable.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	167	They do not see value in the spread of happiness across the population at all (where, as I understand happiness, would actually lead to an increase in happiness).
SpankyTheWhale	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	168	I will admit that I do not have much working knowledge of the robber baron days, even though I have heard of them a lot.
SpankyTheWhale	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	168	My libertarianism is based upon more recent examples.
BigRed	Caltex	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	169	Basically.With regards to military, I'm sure some libertarians are isolationists, but for me, don't confuse isolationism with non-interventionism (what I believe in).
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	170	And what are those examples?I mean... obviously when a country moves from totalitarian authoritarian regime toward libertarianism... it gets better.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	170	Likewise when an extremely socialist country liberalizes a bit, chances are things will get better.But when you start from a relatively liberal country and start deregulating to the point where no one has any protection and there is no longer any policy to attempt to level the playing field... some people are going to be very happy, and a lot of other people are going to become very miserable.
BigRed	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	171	What do you mean exactly by these bolded sections?
JavaBlack	BigRed	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	172	My view of libertarians is that they either assume that the playing field is level or don't care.
JavaBlack	BigRed	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	172	Maybe some just think the playing field will be leveled by some extremely altruistic entity.Also I think they downplay security on the micro level.

JavaBlack	BigRed	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	172	All other entities either lack the agency or lack the motive because they have to rely purely on volunteerism and they are only motivated by profit.I think overall libertarians just ignore the way people really are...
JavaBlack	BigRed	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	172	People have cognitive limitations, tend to make bad decisions when involving long-term goals, get angry and demoralized by too much insecurity, and are just extremely imperfect.Really libertarians are just setting up the field for a certain minority breed of humans that lack normal human qualities concerning risk assessment.
JavaBlack	BigRed	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	172	And they don't even factor in altruism or the fact that most of the successful types are also self-centered and have their own cognitive limitations.Basically either it's Fantasy World... or its the opposite- We can never have a Fantasy World, so (*)(*)(*)(*) it...
JavaBlack	BigRed	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	172	Let's just better the best and (*)(*)(*)(*) the rest.Those are the only motivations I can really link to libertarianism.
JavaBlack	BigRed	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	172	Either bright-eyed idealism or nihilism.
BigRed	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	173	What makes you think a downsized government means a different playing field (one that isn't level)?
JavaBlack	BigRed	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	174	Down-sized government is relative.I think it makes sense to trim government or transform it from time to time.If that's what libertarianism was, it would fail to be a distinct ideology.Libertarianism is an ideology dedicated to cutting down government without regard to how other powerful entities might take control, entities lacking the capacity for accountability found in government.People seem to have gotten the idea that libertarianism is just about cutting federal government but alright with states taking the powers currently attributed to it.That's not the case.
JavaBlack	BigRed	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	174	That is simply the means to an end... allowing whatever localities libertarians live in to become more libertarian.Of course... those localities will most certainly- and not coincidentally- be areas secluded from crime, poverty, and other ills before becoming more libertarian.They will succeed really in seperating the well-off from the poor so that they feel no obligation to help- walling themselves off entirely.Maybe they don't view it that way...
JavaBlack	BigRed	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	174	But that is the end result.
SpankyTheWhale	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	175	Trying to force success doesn't work.I think you misunderstand the free market.
SpankyTheWhale	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	176	That is not true at all.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	178	Success does not come entirely from the individual either.You can't force success, but you can nurture it and make it more likely.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	178	I don't think so.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	178	I'm not the one suggesting that the free market will take care of social ills and level itself out and ensure that people have anywhere near equal opportunity and make sure that power does not get concentrated, etc.The free market does none of those things.Those are social concerns that fall outside the scope of a free market.I'm not the one suggesting free market can replace government... mostly because I know none of these things should be expected from the market.The market certainly runs best without government interference... but the market is not the only determinant of happiness and prosperity in a society.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	178	Of course not.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	178	Because a populist revolt would ensue to keep it from happening...But think about it.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	178	Cutting the federal government out of any area concerning the economy, localizing economies... recipe for divorcing local economies from one another entirely.Say you set policies to raise property values and pay for policing...
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	178	You effectively force out the poor and attract the wealthy from elsewhere.Ultimately you end up with brain-drained poor districts with collapsed economies and no role models for upward mobility... seperated from wealthy areas with booming economies and very little chance of failure for its own citizens.The country takes on the qualities of the anarchic world system, complete with failed states.And do you believe that people will care any more than the abstract way they &quot;care&quot; about starving Africans?
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	178	Do they now?!To a lesser extent this happens now.But there are programs to give opportunity for mobility and federal government allows the programs to exist in localities with need.The libertarians differ from the status quo only in wanting to release themselves from the responsibility and allow for a total segregation of the classes.
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	179	You're completely right!
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	179	Libertarians aren't typically in powerful government positions.
SpankyTheWhale	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	180	You seem to think that the free market is a cut-throat, non-caring force of pain.
SpankyTheWhale	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	180	This is not true.
Diuretic	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	183	I'm not educated in economics but it seems to me that the point JB is making as regards the social impacts is accurate.
Diuretic	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	183	But it's interesting to think of the free market as being something other than amoral.
Diuretic	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	183	Isn't it the case that to take advantage of a free market process first you must have something to trade?
Diuretic	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	183	If that's so, then what about those who have little or nothing to trade?
Diuretic	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	183	How will they benefit from a free market?
Diuretic	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	183	Or have I completely missed the point (always possible)?
Caltex	Tehran Tim	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	185	Very high on the authoritarian scale, likely with a centrist economic position.
White Fox	Diuretic	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	186	Unless you are in a persistent vegatative state, then you have something to trade.
White Fox	Diuretic	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	186	So you haven't really missed the point, you just haven't seen the whole picture.
Skinny.	Diuretic	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	187	When you buy things, it is a part of the market.

Diuretic	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	188	So, for those who aren't in a persistent vegetative stete, what would they have to trade?
Diuretic	Skinny.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	189	What do you use for payment?

Skinny.	Diuretic	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	190	What are you getting at?
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	191	The bolded word is the one that says it all.The market is amoral and uncaring.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	191	It thrives when people chase profit and suffers when people act altruistically.Of course if that goes on long enough... the society around the market falls... but those smart enough to figure that out are smart enough to be Machiavellian.
SpankyTheWhale	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	192	That is simply not true.
SpankyTheWhale	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	192	A free market just means that the government is not doing the caring for you.
SpankyTheWhale	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	192	Every free action or decision is part of the fabric of the free market.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	193	Which makes caring for people a quaint luxury.People's first concerns in a free market will be keeping themselves afloat and saving for the future as much as possible, while trying to live up to what is &quot;normal&quot;.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	193	Charity is a secondary concern for the majority of people.And a 100% free market in the sense libertarians use the term puts a greater burden on those who do put it as a priority while allowing the miserly to go without giving any aid.The market will not correct it... even if charity fails (especially if it only fails to give opportunity).The failure of voluntary charity is not created on immorality.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	193	It is caused by cognitive limitations and the flow of the market.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	193	A libertarian &quot;paradise&quot; equally or even moreso hides the plights of the poor from the well-off... and allows them to ignore it even if they notice (and if there's one thing humans are good at it's rationalization).What does the market do when people fail to live up to their own moral expectations (what?
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	193	someone else will do it!)?
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	193	Nothing.What will it do when the society containing the market is put in danger by concentration of wealth and the loss of stake amongst the poor?
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	193	Nothing.Libertarians apply near-supernatural qualities to the market.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	193	The fact is it is just a human-created system based on how nature appears to us (it is a system, as it contains rules).It is by it's nature a social darwinist system.Anything that breaks that is outside the profit-seeking motive that keeps the market running and on which participants depend for survival.It's dependent on altruism... and yet it does absolutely nothing to encourage altruistic actions, let alone make sure they occur.As such... charity becomes a quaint luxury... until the system collapses at least.A massive problem is that those who &quot;demand&quot; charity are not the people who need it...
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	193	It's the people who want to give to it.Thus, a quaint luxury... regardless of what is actually needed and to what extent.
White Fox	Diuretic	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	194	It's called work, or labor, whether physical or not.

White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	A luxury which people demand.
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	About half of the voting population votes to force everyone to care for people with their money.
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	That's a lot of people who care, and those are just the Democrats.
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	The other half actually gives more to charity.
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	You care deeply about caring for other people, and yet you wouldn't if we had a free market?
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	Libertarians allow people to choose to give to charity, rather than forcing them at gun point with the government.
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	That means people who don't value giving won't give, but it also means that those who do value it will give.
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	I'm a libertarian, but I value giving to others (I spend about 100+ hours a year doing service), just not forcing people to give up what is theirs.
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	And you say that charity is a secondary concern for &quot;most&quot; people.
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	Do you want a minority to force itself on the majority?
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	Doesn't the majority have to vote that force in?
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	How are you going to do this?
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	Charity will only fail when people don't value it.
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	The market is simply the interactions in goods and services of all individuals.
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	Do individuals not give to charity?
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	And a &quot;libertarian 'paradise'&quot; hides nothing, because there's no one forcing anything to be hidden.
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	So long as there are people who care, then there will be concern.
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	You seem to think that if everyone was free, then they would suddenly not care about other people.
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	People will do what people will do.
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	If people don't live up to their own expectations, are you just going to force them to do so?
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	Are people concerned only with profit?
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	Obviously not (look at yourself).
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	And so when people are free to make their own choices, will they suddenly not care about other people.
White Fox	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	195	Is government the origin of all morals?
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	But will the demand to give create a supply high enough for the actual demands?The model does not fit in the way profit does.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	Why do people support social programs?Because most people realize their own cognitive limitations to know that they won't always get around to troublesome things... especially if not necessary or deadlined.Libertarians are the only people who seem to not understand this?
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	Maybe they themselves just don't have as much trouble planning as most human beings.The reality is that the same reason people need help sometimes is why they think there should be mandatory programs.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	Furthermore they like the insurance and the security it brings.Conservatives give more to charity because they are usually more likely to go to church where that is pressured.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	Liberals consider programs a more efficient way to deal with it and most still give a little something (albeit not as much as the largely poor conservatives who give through churches... largely because churches are micro-communities that give a sense of security that comes from community- at the cost of conformity and contact).
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	It will result in far fewer people giving.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	That means a lower supply of charity... also no way of really matching the supply to the actual demands of charity... not unless there was a centrally organized macro-charity that did all the disbursement (and how many libertarians would trust that?)Also since the social welfare is a security concern, collecting taxes for it is no more immoral than collecting for the military or police force.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	It is after self-sustenance and has little to do with self-sustenance (no direct connection).
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	If people don't get around to it, oh well.The majority believe in giving in principle.That doesn't mean they get around to it, they give enough, etc.Also when they do, the miserly minority gains advantage by being absolved from giving (while gaining the social stability benefits... and many would certainly take charity if they needed it).
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	Either the miserly will gain the most power... or there will simply be more misers (most will just say &quot;someone else will do it.&quot;Most people understand that they are not saints or supermen.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	That is why there is support for welfare programs.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	I can't imagine a person who considers the possibility of needing aid from others at some point being a libertarian... nor anyone thatconsiders themselves less than saintly.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	They do give.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	But the demand is for the ability to &quot;feel good&quot;.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	That creates the supply for the actual demand.If it is not enough to meet the actual demand... oh well.And it creates a free-rider problem.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	Libertarians underplay the social stability and progress created by helping the poor and getting them more stake.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	They benefit from it... but don't notice it.So a purely self-interested libertarian... won't give.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	This puts greater burden on those who do- oh wait!
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	It doesn't!
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	Because they give to feel good not in accordance to solving problems... so it just cuts the supply of charity... ultimately cutting the utility of charity.I'd expect more misers to occur from this.The only other possibility is to organize people into small self-sustaining communities where people take care of one another... you know, like the times libertarians (and many communists) fantasize about.The problem is that the maintenance of that would require more control over the individual to work.All the extra programs of liberalism... they are the price we pay for being able to escape a smothering community.No, there is no way you can actually be purely self-sustaining and purely independent and still have the security of society (or the prosperity for that matter).
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	People do not care about what they don't see.And when brought to their attention, the first reaction of people to a worldview-shattering horror is rationalization.Note all the people claiming the nation is color-blind, there are no barriers to the poor, anyone can achieve anything... all wonderful for making the people benefitting from status quo feel good- but it's really just avoiding reality.People need contact with real suffering to actually care in any more than an abstract way.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	That's what societies do.And most people are perfectly willing to &quot;force&quot; themselves!
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	Moreso than they are willing to do it voluntarily.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	Most people get their own minds... and thus how most minds work.

JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	Because I cannot predict the future, I will be quite conservative in my estimates.And when my brain and body get worn out from work and taking care of my own bills and dealing with my marriage...
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	I'm done for the day.That's why I mostly give to charity through paycheck deduction.Most people are similar.

JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	It does not originate morals.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	It's not even fully involved.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	It doesn't take care of all charity... just those that create stability and protect the basics!Financial help for those who can't support themselves.Medical care for those who can't afford it.Education and human capital for those who need skills to work.Communication and transportation for work and civic duty.It doesn't give toys for tots.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	It doesn''t give things that make life better.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	It provides the minimum for security, for national risk pools... or at least it should.I agree with the libertarian philosophy of the libertarian-leaning left.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	Why?
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	Because they (as small a group as it is) understand some social programs are a minimum for protecting life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.Most libertarians simply don't believe that.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	It's evidenced by the numbers willing to give up social programs altogether.I've said it before...
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	Cutting them, getting rid of some, transforming others...
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	I'm all for these things.But destroying social programs gains liberty for no one.
JavaBlack	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	196	It only drives us apart, concentrates power in the hands of few, and puts society's most vulnerable members at risk.

TM2	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	199	Thats an interesting answer to this problem.
TM2	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	199	People will not always be respnsible with their money ( history has proved that.)
TM2	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	199	I would think our country would be in a horrific state if the government sat idly by and was not proactive about helping the poor.
TM2	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	199	You cant assume people will be responsible and donate to charity( some do, some dont.)
TM2	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	199	You talk about free market economics as if its been proven as if there has been some country that has had complete free markets and they work.
TM2	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	199	Economic textbooks are great.
TM2	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	199	They will tell you all about how simply splendid free markets are but dont mention that they have never been comnpletely tried.
TM2	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	199	Even if they were successful it still encourages greed and oppression of the poor.
TM2	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	199	If free markets are declared to work then one cant say that communism doesnt work because its never been tested the right way.
TM2	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	199	So if complete free markets work, then so does communism.
Caltex	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	200	Leftist economic policies are in direct conflict with freedom based libertarianism.
Caltex	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	200	Believing in the freedom of individuals to do as they wish as long as they don't hurt others, and Government stealing wealth in order to forcibly redistribute it don't exactly go together.A left-libertarian is not a libertarian.
Caltex	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	200	They are a social libertarian, economic socialist.
Caltex	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	200	As their libertarianism only applies to social and civil rights, and not to economic rights.
Caltex	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	200	Stealing someones hard earned labor is not libertarian.
White Fox	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	202	Your philosophy isn't libertarianism, and here's the reason:Those social programs you say we need now have to be funded by taking other people's money.
White Fox	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	202	That's it, plain and simple.
White Fox	dittbub	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	204	The left is multi-culturist.
White Fox	dittbub	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	204	The middle is supportive of the national culture.And the right is globalist, the antithesis of multi-culturism and nationalism.
White Fox	dittbub	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	204	But that's just how I see the spectrum with regards to culture.
White Fox	dittbub	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	204	Most people in the US consider the left to be multi-culturist and the right to be nationalist.
White Fox	dittbub	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	204	That, to me, only proves that our country has a true deficit of real conservatives.

Marsupilami	SweetJaine	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	227	To format it like we have it, you need to &quot;insert image&quot; in the post.
Marsupilami	SweetJaine	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	227	To do that, you have to upload the picture from your computer onto the web (ie: photobucket.com).

Agnapostate	SweetJaine	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	228	You have to save the original on your computer, and have to upload it to Photobucket or something.

Marsupilami	rodog	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	234	I found so too.
Marsupilami	rodog	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	234	I think it's because I agreed with the surveillance of citizens.

SpankyTheWhale	Marsupilami	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	235	But, you do, Marsupilami.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	237	So far we agree on nothing.
Skinny.	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	239	Great to see you're so libertarian.
Skinny.	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	239	Though I always pictured you being much further left.
JavaBlack	Skinny.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	240	On American scales I am pretty far left... but in Europe I'd probably be considered a centrist or even a right-winger.
JavaBlack	Skinny.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	240	I'm a mixed economy kind of guy, not a socialist.
JavaBlack	Skinny.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	240	I just tend to attack capitalism more often because, being in America, die hard capitalists are a stronger adversary.
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	242	That's part of why there are two scales on this test.
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	242	The left-right scale only looks at economics...And generally libertarians are &quot;right&quot; of conservatives on economics, especially on a world-scale.
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	242	Conservatives believe in stability above all and will sacrifice some market ideology if necessary to protect the nation... but libertarians tend to be more devoted true-believers to the ideology.Of course by labeling the right &quot;libertarian&quot; the test seems to reject the notion of left-libertarians or libertarian socialists.
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	242	Any leftists on this chart will be marked off as authoritarians or anarchists.
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	245	I agree.
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	245	That's why I've had very different results with different moods.
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	245	I always come out somewhere toward the &quot;anarchist&quot; end... but I've actually been slightly on the right before.A lot of the economic questions are up for interpretation:&quot;Is from each accoding to ability to each according to need a fundamentally good idea?&quot; Maybe.
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	245	In practical terms or in moralistic terms?&quot;A corporations only social responsibility is to it's shareholders&quot;Yeah, I guess.
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	245	It's government's job to fix the problems that result from the market, set the rules, and clean up the messes.
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	245	The companies are merely players.But on the other hand... wouldn't it be nice if they took some responsibility?&quot;Those able to but not willing to work aren't entitled to our support.&quot;I guess not.
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	245	But what do we mean by &quot;support&quot; exactly?
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	245	And how do we determine their ability and willingness?
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	245	I agree with the principle... but to what extent do such people actually exist?
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	245	And if there are many, what good does ignoring them do?Then some of the social ones are even more maddening!&quot;People are too open about sex&quot;I kind of agree... but then again, the alternative is worse.&quot;There is a worrying infusion of information and entertainment&quot;Maybe.
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	245	Yes.
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	245	No.Well, I do find that information gets mixed with crap... but is it really the entertainment aspect that makes it that way?
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	245	I have no issue with entertainment being mixed with fact...
JavaBlack	El_Cid	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	245	It's the garbage mixed with fact I don't like... but that's often a result of infotainment.So I've switched back and forth on many... and even moreso have gone from just a little agreement/disagreement to a lot of agreement/disagreement.
Agnapostate	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	246	I'm not sure I'd agree with that analysis.
Agnapostate	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	246	The chart analysis makes it quite clear that it makes no value judgments about what is &quot;legitimate&quot; economic libertarianism, socialism or capitalism.
JavaBlack	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	247	It's kind of all over the place in regards to these things.
JavaBlack	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	247	But what El Cid was talking about was the (Libertarian) label that is placed on the far right end of the compass.It gets a bit confusing when it puts different labels in different areas of the chart and different parts of the site.
SpankyTheWhale	rockyreagan	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	250	As you should.
SpankyTheWhale	rockyreagan	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	250	You are just barely in libertarian land.

rockyreagan	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	255	Well this test is wrong on alot of issues.
rockyreagan	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	255	It ask some general &quot;societal&quot; questions which is fine but it doesn't deal with &quot;should the government deal with it&quot;.
SpankyTheWhale	rockyreagan	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	256	That distinction tends to be forgotten often in political discourse.

SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	302	You are wrong on both counts.
Agnapostate	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	303	That is not &quot;libertarian.&quot; This is libertarian.Thus far, I have not seen anybody match my perfect social libertarian score.

catawba	CptnRodent	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	308	Interesting!
catawba	CptnRodent	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	308	Let's see if this works:http://www.politicalcompass.org/prin...7.50&amp;soc=-6.05
Agnapostate	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	309	No, you won't.
Agnapostate	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	309	You'd have to love freedom and/or liberty to do that.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	310	Apparently you don't give a (*)(*)(*)(*) about liberty when it comes to money.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	312	What tyranny?
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	312	honestly i don't see it!
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	312	Please show me it or ill have to assume your all raving mad!
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	316	Nobody is forcing him to work in his current capacity, nor are they forcing him to work for them at all.
Agnapostate	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	317	And his alternative is to starve.
Agnapostate	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	317	That is not a viable or legitimate second option, just as you &quot;consenting&quot; to hand over your valuables when a man points a gun at you is not a legitimate form of consent.
Agnapostate	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	317	The only other alternative is death.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	318	The worker doesn't need 'democratic' control over his happenings hes at work.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	318	The worker made an agreement to give his time for money.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	318	If he's not happy at work he can quite and work somewhere else any time he wants.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	318	'Punished' no that can't happen employers can't punish a worker in any way whatsoever because the workers are free to leave any time they please and quit if their not happy.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	318	And a corporation is not a government because it holds no authority.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	319	Nope.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	319	Try again.
Agnapostate	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	320	And his alternative is? To go to another hierarchical workplace.
Agnapostate	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	320	A worker can choose not to have a particular job, but the fundamental issue is that he cannot choose not to have a job at all.
Agnapostate	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	320	Again, if there were a set of islands controlled by a set of kings, and you were free to move between them, you could not argue that you would escape monarchy by moving to a different island.
Agnapostate	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	320	You would just escape a specific monarch.Corporations hold plenty of authority; they hold a monopoly in the realm of private tyranny.
Agnapostate	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	320	Because they control the means of production, they are able to govern the workings of society.
Agnapostate	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	320	An unelected, tyrannical group of upper class elitists control this country.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	321	Not all workplaces are run like nazi germany.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	321	Despite what you've read on the internet.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	321	Employees can always move to a workplace where the boss and employees act peacefully and happily with each other.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	321	Or if you just hate having a boss regardless of how nice they are you can go into buissness for youself...
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	321	Simple.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	321	No the government controls the country.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	321	And their is miles of legislation preventing monopolys from not playing fair.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	321	For example phone companies can't control who you can and cannot call.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	321	Thats illegal...
Agnapostate	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	322	Of course there are.
Agnapostate	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	322	And in the same manner, there was plenty of love between black slaves and white masters.
Agnapostate	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	322	The simple fact of the matter is that the fundamental hierarchical, anti-democratic relationship is inherently negative, regardless of how the boss chooses to exploit it.
Agnapostate	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	322	And who controls the government?
Agnapostate	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	322	Business interests behind the two major parties.
Agnapostate	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	322	The means of production are in private hands, and thus cannot be democratically managed.
annijones	JW Frogen	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	323	Canada is a social democracy and guess what, quietly, we are doing very well.

TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	325	Your under a bizzare assumption that all heirarchical relationships are bad.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	325	They are not.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	325	They can be peaceful and voluntary.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	325	Democracy is great for choosing leaders.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	325	But not for making every single decision that every needs to be made.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	325	There is nothing wrong with people saying &quot;Ok this will be done quicker if one guy leads the group&quot; or &quot;Ok ill come work for you just tell me where you need me!&quot; hierarchy and democracy both have their places.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	325	In the office one guys cubicle has the printer.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	325	At the barbeque one guy gets to serve everyone their hotdog etc...
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	325	Buisnesses don't vote.

TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	325	Its there choice who they vote for not &quot;Evil capitalists&quot;...
annijones	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	327	Well, as a 61 year old mother of a grown man, I'd wonder of about your ability to determine gender, but then I remembered... most American men do not like pushy women.
annijones	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	327	Boy, did I have fun when I was working in the states as the push with my own company!!!!

LiveUninhibited	Joe Castro	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	333	I think a more accurate quiz would require more questions, and fewer loaded questions, but still not terribly inaccurate:Conservative/Progressive score: 10 You are a social progressive.

LiveUninhibited	Joe Castro	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	333	You think that Health Care should be free to all, that the minimum wage should be raised, and that the government should provide jobs to all that are capable of having them.
LiveUninhibited	Joe Castro	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	333	You likely hated the Bush tax cuts, and believe that the middle class has gotten poorer, and the rich have gotten richer over the past several years.

LiveUninhibited	Joe Castro	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	333	You also believe the US spends way too much of its money on defense, as we can practically cut it in half and still easily defend ourselves, and use that money to fix all our economic problems.
LiveUninhibited	Joe Castro	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	333	Well, it does appear you're an authoritarian in a fiscal sense.
Stanislav	Perham	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	334	You could watch star trek and learn about the Borg - they're all one mind - interesting but I'm not going at that.
Stanislav	Perham	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	334	My Utopia would not be robotic, but everyone would have their distinct role in society depending on their skills.

TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	340	Marxism isn't authoritarian Agnes.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	340	I certainly hope you know that.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	341	You have a rather twisted view of economics.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	341	My biggest problem with you is that you fail to present a cogent argument for your economic authoritarianism which should end in anarchism ultimately.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	342	Fine.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	342	Marxist-Leninism as practiced by the Soviet Union and China is brutal, authoritarian, and anti-democratic, if that elaboration does anything for you.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	342	I was not aware that I supported economic authoritarianism; it seemed as though the capitalist spectrum was on the other side of the compass to me.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	343	You are making a weak point here.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	343	Capitalism is far less authoritarian because it supports little to no government involvement in the economy.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	343	I am a socialist of a sort, but I will not tolerate lies or fatal flaws in economic logic whichever.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	344	You are a socialist of a non-sort.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	344	Perhaps you consider yourself to be a social democrat, but you would then be better described as a mixed-market capitalist.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	344	Capitalism is authoritarian precisely because it creates private forms of tyranny when left unchecked, and perpetuates the effects of state intervention.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	344	Previous economic systems such as feudalism, as well as the manner of capitalism which has been traditionally practiced in the United States, in which certain minority groups were directly disenfranchised by the state, involve heavy forms of state intervention, and its effects are only perpetuated by a legacy of private tyranny.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	345	Well aren't we smart?
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	345	No not really, I am a socialist I believe that markets yes do need to exist to some extent, but there are specific socialist ideals and and practices iI would seek to adopt.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	345	If you want me to prove that is socialistic just look at how the British government or the Swedish government operates.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	345	Your logic in saying capitalism is authoritarian is completely flawed.Capitalism can really only end in authoritarianism if a monopoly occurs.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	346	And as I said, those are social democracies.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	346	Social democracy might be more accurately described as a form of mixed-market capitalism, or a very mild form of market socialism, if you want to stretch it there.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	346	There is a capitalistic monopoly in this country and in every other capitalistic nation in the world.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	346	It is not one of any specific corporation or entity, it is one of the capitalist economic system as a whole.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	346	No other systems can feasibly operate in an industrialized capitalist society.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	347	That claim about capitalism is so ridiculously unsubstantiated by any expert it makes me laugh.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	348	Instead of making inane and pointless remarks, you could try responding to the claims made in a rational manner.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	349	Actually I won't.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	349	Debate format would postulate that any claim must be substantiated with evidence, I haven't been requesting it so far because your views are generally able to be substantiated, as mine are.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	349	I will respond to this ridiculous comment when you provide proof that such an astounding claim has any amount of credibility.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	349	I won't be tricked into dirtying my hands in ridiculous unsubstantiated claims of a teenager.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	349	1 shred of evidence and I will respond.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	350	Ah, here we are...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	351	Oh very nice, you prove my point you know.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	351	You pick one line out say its ad hominem and then proceed to ignore the fact that you made an evidenceless claim were called on your bull(*)(*)(*)(*) and are caught.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	351	I apologize for saying you are a teenager Now would you care to substantiate the claim that you have so far not shown one shred of proof for?
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	352	The claim about capitalism being tyrannical?
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	352	I explained that it perpetuated the effects of state intervention by allowing the tyrannical social structures created by direct forms of state intervention to stand.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	352	For instance, direct collaboration between state and capitalist tyranny allowed the institution of black slavery to exist.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	352	Blacks were later disenfranchised through forms of state tyranny such as Jim Crow laws.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	352	This has contributed to the current poor and social economic status of blacks in America, and the fact that &quot;welfare reform&quot; is implemented, rather than legitimate social programs to help blacks created is a form of the perpetuation of direct state intervention and tyranny.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	353	There is a capitalistic monopoly in this country and in every other capitalistic nation in the world.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	353	It is not one of any specific corporation or entity, it is one of the capitalist economic system as a whole.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	353	No other systems can feasibly operate in an industrialized capitalist society.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	353	Substantiate that claim with a single shred of evidence and I will respond to it until then, i will assume it is not credible, yes because you are a teenager and no that is not ad hominem, because one teenager can not be trusted to make a claim like this and it be true unless evidence is presented.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	353	Nither can anyone else
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	354	It is a reference to the fact that one cannot avoid the wage slavery that is promoted by capitalism.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	354	For instance, the robbery analogy is applicable here once again.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	354	If a thief were to tackle a man and rip his valuables out of his pockets, we would rightly call this a robbery.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	354	However, if a thief were to point a gun at the man and demand that he hand over his valuables, we would also call this a robbery, although he technically &quot;consented&quot; to hand over his property.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	354	But his &quot;consent&quot; was meaningless, as his alternative The first instance is intended to represent the directly coercive nature of state tyranny.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	354	It is brutal and straightforward, as is a physically forceful robbery.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	354	The second instance is intended to represent the more subtle nature of capitalistic tyranny.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	354	You technically &quot;consent&quot; to serve a master in a hierarchical workplace, but you have no viable alternative, as the only other option is eventual starvation and homelessness because you cannot pay for food and shelter without wages.
Agnapostate	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	354	That is the nature of wage slavery.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	355	I am indeed going to turn in, but I just wanted to point out that you refuse to substantiate you claims (which I understand so you don't need to further explain them) with evidence, so I will assume as any reasonable person would that you have none.
TheChief	Skinny.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	359	It is a natural progression towards perfection...

Stanislav	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	363	Socialists and Communists are definitely left wing, as are the Green ecologist parties but DEMOCRATS ARE NOT LEFT-WING, I REPEAT, DEMOCRATS ARE NOT LEFT-WING!!!!!

Joe Castro	Stanislav	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	364	I mean when did pro business, capitalist ideology become left wing?
White Fox	Stanislav	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	366	Proof of how completely ridiculous everything is in Europe.
White Fox	Stanislav	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	366	Democrats AND Republicans in this country are left wing.Europe is just plain twisted.
Agnapostate	Joe Castro	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	367	Exactly.
Agnapostate	Joe Castro	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	367	It's so manifestly absurd to see capitalism described as being &quot;left-wing.&quot; The Democrats and Republicans are both far right on an international scale.
catawba	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	368	Our parties are so far to the right, they have dabbled in corporatism.Looks to me like Europe, and our neighbors, Canada, have us pegged about right.
catawba	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	368	Our conservatives make their conservatives look like liberals.

TM2	Skinny.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	369	Most issues I'm progressive a few core ones I am conservative on
TM2	Skinny.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	371	I am pro gun control and for free healthcare.
SpankyTheWhale	Skinny.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	372	Supporting gun rights should rightly be called &quot;social liberal.&quot;
TheChief	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	373	Yes it should.
TheChief	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	373	The whole idea of social conservatism is to control what you do who you marry, what you smoke, what you can say so on...
TheChief	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	373	Gun rights should be supported by the left.
Agnapostate	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	374	Looky here.

White Fox	catawba	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	382	Define &quot;right-wing&quot; for starters.
catawba	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	383	(See above)
White Fox	catawba	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	384	That circular logic is making your head spin.
catawba	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	385	If you would like a review of policies supported by the right wing (again).Doubling of military spending that has contributed to our economic meltdown.Doubling of the National debt during the current administration that has contributed to our economic meltdown.War to secure U.S. friendly control of the Middle East oil reserves for the oil corporations, at taxpayer expense that has contributed to our economic meltdown.Tax cuts to the wealthy that has resulted in 10% of the population with 80% of the wealth that have contributed to our economic meltdown.Deregulation of the financial markets that have contributed to our economic meltdown.That is how I define right-wing!
White Fox	catawba	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	386	You haven't defined an ideology at all, merely the actions of a political party.
catawba	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	387	I define a party by their actions, not by their words.
catawba	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	387	The policies I listed above represent the right-wing party I have grown to know and despise.

SpankyTheWhale	kiwimac	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	409	So you are comparing the Clinton era to the Bush legacy?
SpankyTheWhale	kiwimac	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	409	You are comparing what was going on while Clinton was president to what will happen after Bush leaves office?
SpankyTheWhale	kiwimac	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	409	Shouldn't you either compare Clinton's era to Bush's era, or Clinton's legacy to Bush's legacy?
SpankyTheWhale	kiwimac	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	409	Hint: I don't think you like Clinton's legacy, because it means the stuff that happened after he left office, 2001-now.

frodly	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	411	I just finished the stupid thing( I don't know why), and he ends with thisWhether you like it or not, the founding fathers of these United States felt that the right to gun ownership was second ONLY to the right to free speech.First thing, the first amendment actually guarantees 5 rights, not 1.
frodly	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	411	So if we are insulting intelligence, that should be brought up.

frodly	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	439	I like that one better as well.On Non-Fiscal Issues, you rank as a Strong Liberal (17).
frodly	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	439	On Fiscal Issues, you rank as a Moderate Liberal (31).I like this one, because I am fiscally moderate, and socially liberal.
frodly	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	439	The other one has me as a fiscal liberal too.
frodly	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	439	That is because it asks question like &quot;Making a profit is the only responsibility of corporations.&quot; Obviously I disagree with that, who wouldn't?
frodly	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	439	But those are the questions that decide the economic section.

White Fox	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	443	On Fiscal Issues, you rank as a Strong Conservative (92).

Agnapostate	Skinny.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	447	I don't know what happened to you.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	448	Shut up, you pick-pocketing liberal socialist.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	448	LOL.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	448	I heard a guy in the library refer to Obama that way - I thought it was hilarious.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	448	&quot;Pick-pocketing.&quot; LOL.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	448	Too funny.
Agnapostate	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	449	That might work better if I were a liberal or a Marxist.
TheChief	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	450	He got a taste of freedom pie and he liked it!
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	451	Close enough.
Agnapostate	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	452	No, not really.
Agnapostate	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	452	According to the Political Compass, you are closer to both liberalism and Marxism than I am.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	453	'Eh, but according to the other test I am an evil conservative, although moderate.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	453	Don't really know how I am, though.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	453	I reckon it's because of my views on abortion and the fact that I, generally, think charity is a more effective way of dealing with poverty.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	453	Albeit, I do NOT advocate stopping welfare programs that currently exist.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	453	I just think small churches and other organizations can work one-on-one with an individual to help them, whereas the government just sends them a check (most of the time).Other than that, don't much see how my views put me in the conservative column.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	453	Centrist?
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	453	Of course.
TheChief	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	455	And here you were saying you were fiscally moderate when you just a plain ol' liberal...
SpankyTheWhale	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	456	You seem to be consistently disappointed in your political test results.
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	457	I just want something with more... gusto!Perhaps I should start taking up bizarre and inconsistent stances...
SpankyTheWhale	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	458	Like Socially Conservative Socialist?
JavaBlack	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	459	How about totalitarian anarchism?
SpankyTheWhale	JavaBlack	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	460	How about socially liberal authoritarianism?
White Fox	Perham	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	461	Click on second link from left and search &quot;Rothbard&quot; and you'll find some stuff:..................................................
TM2	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	462	Thats actually not an inconsistent stance.
TM2	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	462	If you knew anything about some of the aspects of historical socialism you would know that.
TM2	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	462	For me im a democratic socialist, socially im semi conservative, like on abortion, but im pro gun control and the like really just abortion and a couple other things.
TM2	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	462	In general I'm overwhelmingly liberal.
TM2	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	462	Of course I know you werent describing me but i am pro life, which would make me in some peoples eyes socially conservative though im not on most things.
TM2	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	462	Besides socialism is an economic system it doesnt have a position on abortion, if people have come to believe that then they are wrong, and the people who suggest that it should are foolish.
SpankyTheWhale	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	463	I'm willing to throw that idea away.
SpankyTheWhale	TM2	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	463	I was just trying to think of something that would be contradictory.
Agnapostate	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	464	Yes, that's not necessarily a contradictory stance.
Agnapostate	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	464	Christian socialists, for instance, can favor egalitarian economic policies to aid the poor while maintaining the same views on abortion and homosexuality as other socially conservative Christians.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	465	precisely.
TM2	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	465	Good analysis
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	466	What about Christian anarchists, Agna?
Agnapostate	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	467	What about them?
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	468	Is that contradictory?
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	468	To be a Christian and an anarchist?
Agnapostate	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	470	No, unless you have a low opinion of Leo Tolstoy.
catawba	katiegrrl0	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	472	I think yours might look similar to mine here Katie . . .
catawba	katiegrrl0	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	472	off the grid!!!
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	474	Just figured that because anarchists are opposed to all authority, they would oppose the Bible, as it is the authority on God to Christians.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	474	And Catholic anarchists?
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	474	Do they not regard the Pope as an authority?Personally, I think anarchists, in general, are idiots who contradict themselves at every turn.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	474	But that's just me.
Agnapostate	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	475	I thought I already told you that Christian anarchists need not regard the hierarchical church as necessary for their religious beliefs.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	476	What do they regard as necessary for their religious beliefs?
Independent-Thinker	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	477	Seemingly, just the name of their God, and not necessarily anything about that God.
Independent-Thinker	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	477	How can you be a Christian yet not regard the Bible as the best authority on God?
Agnapostate	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	478	I would imagine that they cherish Christlike values of compassion for the poor, egalitarianism, opposition to strict church law, and opposition to many forms of state authority.
TheChief	Talo76	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	480	Don't belittle your own colours.
TheChief	Talo76	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	480	Let them shine...
Talo76	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	481	I am not belittling anything, I am just saying that this political test is hardly the best way to differentiate views, it's also American-centric in it's questions and defines everything in an American right-shifted way.
TheChief	Talo76	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	482	Where do you feel you belong on this graph?
frodly	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	484	My favorite author was a christian anarchist.
frodly	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	485	That is just silly.
frodly	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	485	Anarchists reject earthly authority.
frodly	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	485	If you believe in god, it is impossible to reject god's authority.
frodly	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	485	I really don't understand your argument on this one.
Agnapostate	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	486	I would hazard a guess at it being Tolstoy.
frodly	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	487	You are right.
katiegrrl0	catawba	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	488	That would be about the spot maybe just a tad more to the left then that.
katiegrrl0	catawba	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	488	But just a little bit.
katiegrrl0	catawba	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	488	Thanks for locating me on the grid.
katiegrrl0	catawba	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	488	Well off the grid.
Independent-Thinker	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	489	Anarchists reject authority, do they not?
Independent-Thinker	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	489	They reject religious authority as well.
Independent-Thinker	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	489	Therefore, you would think - if you learn this from Agna's link - they reject all religious authority, including the Bible, which, although I may be wrong, is an &quot;earthly authority.&quot; Furthermore, he made mention of anarchist Catholics.
Independent-Thinker	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	489	How, pray tell, can you be a Catholic whilst not regarding the Pope as any type of authority?
Independent-Thinker	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	489	For, if they reject the Pope and the authority of the Church, then they are not Catholics.
Independent-Thinker	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	489	Now, perhaps this goes back to people not expressing themselves clearly enough.
Independent-Thinker	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	489	Do they mean by &quot;authority&quot; a person?
Independent-Thinker	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	489	If so, then they would have no problem with a doctrine of laws, correct?
Independent-Thinker	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	489	If so, who, pray tell, will enforce those laws?
Independent-Thinker	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	489	An, ahem, authority?What I find silly is the fact that your ignorance causes you to demean another person's argument.
frodly	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	490	The bible is not an earthly authority if you believe god is real.
frodly	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	490	I don't, so i agree that it is an earthly authority, but it isn't if you believe it is the law of god.
frodly	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	490	Also, Tolstoy was a christian anarchist, and he was excommunicated from the Russian orthodox church, for questioning the authority of the church.
frodly	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	490	So a christian anarchist rejects church authority, government authority, just not god's authority.
Independent-Thinker	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	491	Um, okay...
Agnapostate	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	492	Do you know anything whatsoever about the nature of religious anarchism?
Agnapostate	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	492	Which religious Christians consider the Bible to be an &quot;earthly authority,&quot; and not the Word of a Divine Authority?
Agnapostate	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	492	Is coercive subservience to the Pope a regular staple of the life of an average Catholic?
Agnapostate	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	492	Does every Catholic adhere to precisely the same doctrines, or have they ever?
Agnapostate	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	492	Do you know nothing about the Catholic Worker Movement?
frodly	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	493	Just so you know, I wasn't trying to insult you.
frodly	Independent-Thinker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	493	It seemed to me like you were disagreeing with agna, just for the sake of disagreeing with him(which I admit is often tempting).
Agnapostate	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	494	Though fruitless.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	495	If you don't accept the Church as a religious authority, then you are not, by their standards, a Catholic.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	495	Furthermore, it's lovely that you completely misunderstand the passage and what it is supposed to mean.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	495	Jesus was implying that we should serve ourselves and not look to our leaders for it.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	495	This has nothing at all to do with anarchy.
Independent-Thinker	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	495	If you were a Church goer, as I am byway of being forced, then you might have heard a Priest, Pastor, or someone who has studied the word of God their entire life explain it.
Independent-Thinker	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	496	I disagree with Agna a lot because he is wrong a lot.
Independent-Thinker	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	496	He comes to illogical conclusions and attempts to attune them, so to speak, by appealing to authority on a constant basis, not recognizing that those &quot;authorities&quot; have been, time and again, proven wrong.
Independent-Thinker	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	496	As was the case with Mead; the little chicken hasn't officially taken his latest whooping.
Independent-Thinker	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	496	That is, he hasn't responded.
JavaBlack	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	499	I think the origins of the terms &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; are actually based on economic philosophy.In the French revolutionary assembly (whatever the hell it was called) the left side was where the representatives of the poor were and the right was where the elites' representatives were.That's why &quot;left-wing&quot; is used to describe folks like Chavez... but never the word &quot;liberal&quot;.Liberals would be in that diagnal bottom-left area with leftish economic views and libertine social outlook.
JavaBlack	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	499	Of course it all depends on how we're using these terms on any given day.But I guarantee while you'll hear Stalin called &quot;left-wing&quot; you'll never hear him called &quot;liberal&quot;.
JavaBlack	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	499	And a lot of the commie old guard in Russia are referred to as &quot;conservatives.&quot;Likewise despite his totalitarianism, Stalin would never be called &quot;right-wing&quot; but may certainly be called authoritarian.
White Fox	Lex Talionias	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	501	Don't worry.
White Fox	Lex Talionias	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	501	That can be cured with liberal application of reason
Ferris	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	504	I find this to be more accurate to American politics.
Ferris	TheChief	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	504	Which shows some of the inherent biases to the test, seeing as we don't vote the way we generalize:
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	508	That score is not about &quot;Libertarianism.&quot; It is about freedom with respectg to social issues.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	508	The horisontal line measures economic freedom, and you want to take everybody'smoney.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	508	You are no Libertarian.
Agnapostate	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	509	The horizontal line measures economic freedom, and capitalism is the opposite of that.
Agnapostate	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	509	You are no libertarian.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	511	You can't just make things up just because you want to find labels you find positive to associate with yourself.
White Fox	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	512	Freedom is the freedom to make one's own choices about what they do so long as they don't keep someone else from making their own decisions.
White Fox	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	512	Making one's own economic choices without keeping other people from making their own economic decisions is economic freedom, and that's called capitalism.
Agnapostate	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	513	Our economic claims are a stalemate that cancel each other out, so I end up being more of a libertarian than you are because I'm a greater social libertarian.
White Fox	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	515	Why?
White Fox	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	515	Is it because you said that abstract art has a purpose?
White Fox	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	515	No political test can be used to accurately compare people on grounds such as &quot;social libertarianism.&quot; I strongly believe that people should be allowed to do anything they want so long as it doesn't infringe on the rights of others, which, in my opinion, makes me a perfect social libertarian.
White Fox	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	515	The test is simply biased towards party division and/or contemporary associated beliefs towards left and right with questions like the one on abstract art.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	516	Wow.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	516	That is quite the cop out.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	516	I am impressed.
Agnapostate	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	517	Yes, as opposed to
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	518	Yeah.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	518	What is the problem?
Agnapostate	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	519	The lack of a response.
frodly	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	520	Isn't it something like is absract art, art?
frodly	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	520	If that is the question, why would you say no? That requires you to define art, something no person with any amount of modesty would do.
White Fox	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	521	But abstract art has a purpose only if art has a purpose.
White Fox	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	521	And I would define art as something that has no purpose of persuasion intended by the artist, and yet instills a different sense of meaning to different people depending on their interpretation.
White Fox	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	521	Yeah, yeah, I defined art.
White Fox	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	521	Don't say anything about modesty.
White Fox	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	521	But the real question is, why would one's answer to that question determine how socially liberal they were?
Agnapostate	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	522	No mention of &quot;purpose&quot; was made.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	523	I see that you are eager to be proven wrong, but it saddens me that I cannot yet meet your expectations on this one question.
White Fox	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	524	And yet the point remains.
Agnapostate	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	525	That is false.
Agnapostate	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	525	Since the question ran along the lines of &quot;Abstract art that doesn't represent anything isn't really art at all,&quot; it was necessary for one to distinguish between what they personally considered &quot;art&quot; and what they did not, and hostility toward &quot;deviant&quot; art was a hallmark of fascist regimes.
frodly	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	526	I am pretty consistent.
frodly	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	526	This is the 3rd time I took it.
frodly	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	526	The last 2 I was basically in the same placehttp://www.politicalcompass.org/prin...5.75&amp;soc=-6.77
Agnapostate	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	527	That's not bad.
White Fox	Luc1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	531	The &quot;right&quot; on the chart refers to economic policy.
White Fox	Luc1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	531	As far as fascists go, their militaristic, corporatist, Keynesian, authoritarian economic policies fall on the far left.
White Fox	Luc1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	531	They then chose to mix up that far left economic policy with an authoritarian social structure that many people associate with the &quot;right.&quot; Nothing's mess-up that much with the chart, it's just fascism that's messed up.
White Fox	Ferris	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	533	Fine, then just know that you're a right-winger compared to me.
Agnapostate	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	536	Policies of that nature are diametrically opposed to the nature of egalitarianism that most socialist and communist organizations advocate, and are thus more closely affiliated with the right.
TM2	Luc1	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	538	I agree with that assessment.
SpankyTheWhale	Ferris	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	540	We have?
SpankyTheWhale	Ferris	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	540	When?
SpankyTheWhale	Ferris	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	542	And they gae us far more economic freedom.
White Fox	Ferris	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	543	The vertical scale isn't the only authoritarian scale.And the &quot;right&quot; isn't defined by politicians who call themselves so.
SpankyTheWhale	WhiteHaven	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	546	So you are Nazi?
White Fox	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	547	Well, let's take a look at &quot;WhiteHaven's&quot; previous posts.
White Fox	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	547	From the &quot;Who's your role model&quot; thread:
SpankyTheWhale	Daktoria	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	549	It is not that simple at all.
SpankyTheWhale	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	550	So it makes sense.
Daktoria	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	551	Sorry to hear ur from LA.
SpankyTheWhale	Daktoria	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	552	Yeah, I don't like to think about it.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	554	Yeah, it must break your heart that I suffer so.
Agnapostate	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	555	No, I suffer so from your proximity.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	556	That could go a lot of good ways.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	556	I cannot even choose three, let alone narrow down to one.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	560	Put that authoritarianism away from us!
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	561	I will never be an anarchist which is essentially what 100% libertarian would be.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	563	I have a perfect social libertarian score.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	564	I believe it is impossible to obtain that score.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	564	I can either get a -10.0 social score or a -10.0 economic score, but it always throws the other off to 9.5 or something, revealing a basic bias against anarcho-socialism.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	564	What looks even stupider is not backing up grand assertions, (i.e. &quot;you are a nutbag anarchist&quot;), with legitimate argument as to the invalidity of anarchism.
XVZ	parker	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	565	Is that what you meant to do?
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	565	Do you often ask for a proof of a negative?
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	565	Anyway, I've explained to you elsewhere that the majority of people are too effing retarded for either anarchy or socialism to be productive.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	566	Try again.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	567	You cannot not disprove the history of mankind with opinions.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	567	It is often the most retarded among us that think everyone is intelligent...
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	568	I don't think everyone's intelligent.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	568	Far from it, in fact.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	568	But by the same token, I think people are made unintelligent by a system of mass conformity that is in place.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	569	People are not made unintelligent.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	569	People are naturally unintelligent.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	569	Humans have a natural tendency towards emotional and irrational logic by connecting patterns that often have no business being connected.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	569	It takes a lot of training and skill to become a rational thinker.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	569	Even then it is difficult for most to overcome irrational deduction or beliefs.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	570	Your claims are dogmatic and hinge on extremism.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	570	The converse claim would be that humans are the much-touted tabula rasa at birth, and can be formed into whatever sort of beings wider society would designate for them.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	570	When it comes to the nature vs. nurture debate, just stick to the middle of the road.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	570	There's nothing more harmonious than the happy medium.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	571	Stick to the truth.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	571	The &quot;happy medium&quot; is just a (often false) shortcut that is only happy due to a facade that must be maintained because there is nothing inherently beneficial about the middle of the road.
SpankyTheWhale	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	571	There is only inherent non-&quot;extremism.&quot;
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	572	There is nothing dogmatic about my claim which comes from basic science.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	572	It is you that is perpetuating dogmatic claims unless you can provide evidence for that which you claim and get off of your utopia-dopey idiocy.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	572	Those well educated in a certain field should be the leaders of said field as the more educated (rational education, I do not consider hypothetical/theological dope to be education) are able to filter out irrationality the best.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	572	And the free market allows those that put forward the best ideas to be the most successful.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	572	There is no need in this system to know the best models a priori as the best models will natural rise to success.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	572	Socialism does require this knowledge as a model must be chosen to implement in socialistic structures.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	572	To have everyone have input into the decisions of areas that they are not well versed is a call for disaster and the knowledge of the world is simply too vast for everyone to be knowledgable about everything.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	572	And quite frankly it is even worse to suspect that a majority will ever be knowledgable about much of anything at all.
WhiteHaven	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	573	If you want to put it into the shortened version yes i am.
WhiteHaven	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	573	I believe in all points of the NS ideology, especially the economics area.
WhiteHaven	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	573	I see what it did for germany and i only wish i get to see what it can do for my country one day.
White Fox	WhiteHaven	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	574	So go ahead and try to defend militarized Keynesianism since you mentioned economics in particular.
Agnapostate	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	575	I stick to the truth privately.
Agnapostate	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	575	I stick to the expediency of compromise publicly.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	575	Nobody's interested in having everybody be &quot;knowledgeable about everything,&quot; which completely derails your claims.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	575	Where did you get these ideas?
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	576	My claims have little to do with anyone being interested in everyone being &quot;knowledgeable about everything,&quot; which is the thesis of your entire post.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	576	Thus I will backtrack a bit to escape the dark pit your post sunk us to.There are people intereted in having everyone have a say in how things are run however.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	576	The first line from your &quot;try again&quot; link (by the way, how completely retarded does one need to be to have to rely soley on the work or authority of another?)
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	576	was:We are sorry to have to include this question in an anarchist FAQ, but we know that many political ideologies explicitly assume that ordinary people are too stupid to be able to manage their own lives and run society.How do you propose everyone &quot;run society&quot; without a rather direct say in decision making?
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	576	That is the extreme left position, to have a collective voice.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	576	I am simply telling you that a menial task worker that any idiot could master in a day has no business having any say in the decisions of management.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	576	Management is to be run solely by those with the intellectual training and brain power for such a task.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	576	And those management teams that are run by a less than stellar group will make bad decision and fade away in the free market.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	576	Now I also would like everyone to have the opportunity to be intellectually equipped and sucessful.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	576	However, not everyone is interested in achieving a good education and to them I say, there is role to be filled..
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	576	And that the ability to breathe does not qualify one to have a voice in how business is run.A voice in government however is a different matter, but that is because I believe government's responsibility should be for protection, not to run things.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	576	I am for most protective regulations, but as soon as those regulation start dictating how things are to be run, they lose my support.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	576	For instance, if a bank wants to only cater to rich individuals, they should be able to.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	576	There is no reason good enough for the government to mandate that they give money to people they may not be qualified approving loans for.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	577	Ugh.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	577	Who's interested in your elitist pandering?
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	577	Those who are not &quot;intellectually gifted&quot; have been made thusly by societal pressures, not from any natural affliction.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	577	The authors cited, as well as myself, propose alleviating those societal pressures through the abolition of unjustified hierarchical authority structures to address this problem.
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	577	Consider this: Does it look to be a disheveled wreck mismanaged by the average idiot to you?
Agnapostate	XVZ	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	577	This is the Hotel Bauen, one of several hundred Argentine enterprises expropriated and placed under the direct democratic management of their workers.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	578	I assure you that I am not the least bit offended by being called elitist.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	578	A lot of people are contemptible, there is no reason to lie and be nice about it.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	578	You are just lucky that is not considered deragatory (even though I am sure you meant it in an offensive manner) or else someone with a toy maimed (not like jew) might come along and give you infractions.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	578	You still don't get it.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	578	Everyone by nature is irrational when it comes to things they are not well versed in.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	578	One may be the most successful business leader in his field and still be total chit for brains when it comes to something like medicine.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	578	They shouldn't have a say in what medical procedures (for instance some voodoo practice) are acceptable and to be paid for in say a public manner.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	578	Such decisions are to be left to medical professionals.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	578	A single hotel is not a hard thing to manage, though I suspect the everyday workers didn't have much to anything to do with getting operations off the ground.
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	578	Also, I wouldn't want them making decisions concerning future expansion of other locations or buying out/moving the hotel in the future as demands may change (neighborhood goes ghetto).
XVZ	Agnapostate	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	578	One's input that might center around considering which is the longer drive is not constructive to the future health of the business.
White Fox	DorkdoltConservative	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	583	It's a Commie.....RUN!!!
DorkdoltConservative	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	584	So what if i'm in the same square with Stallin, that doesn't make me a bad person
SpankyTheWhale	DorkdoltConservative	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	585	Stalin didn't turn bad because of his mustache...I think.

Skinny.	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	592	No need to go jumping out of your pants here.
SpankyTheWhale	Skinny.	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	593	And I was being smugly wry.
Ivan	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	594	I didn't say I would...I said I could...Quit putting words in my mouth!
Kazikli Bey	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	596	Well, the poll doesn't reflect the reality of the world situation at all, so i don't see why it bothers you.
SpankyTheWhale	Kazikli Bey	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	597	The reality of the world situation bothers him even more.
SpankyTheWhale	Kazikli Bey	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	597	This was his one sanctuary.
Kazikli Bey	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	598	In a way, Marx was right, the world is slowly turning left wing, he just got it wrong as to how , poor Foxy.
SpankyTheWhale	Kazikli Bey	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	599	IS the world turning left wing as a path to declining, or shifting tracks?
SpankyTheWhale	Kazikli Bey	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	599	You should know my answer.
Kazikli Bey	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	600	Well, if you call countries becoming democratic a decline...
Kazikli Bey	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	600	but then again, i never said the path would continue that way, or it was a shift of tracks.
Kazikli Bey	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	600	The world is just one great boat ride without a compass.
Kazikli Bey	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	600	We'll eventually hit land, but we have no idea where we are, or where we'll land.
SpankyTheWhale	Kazikli Bey	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	602	We are talking about leftism, not democracy.
Kazikli Bey	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	603	But you missed my point.
Kazikli Bey	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	603	I said that maybe Marx was partly right in his assumption that the working class would rise up, he was just wrong on how it would happen.
Kazikli Bey	SpankyTheWhale	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	603	I believe that as more countries become democratic with full suffrage, they will swing slightly more to the left then the far right.
hkobb7	White Fox	http://www.politicalforum.com/opinion-polls/43727-where-do-you-stand-political-spectrum.html	604	Well, better than the socialists or the liberals.

<b>John1735</b>	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	221	And not because the movement stands a real chance of kicking these liberals out of political power.These libtards themselves resort to the use of hateful, sexualy, explicit denigrating, derogatory, terminology as &quot;tea bagger&quot;.It does not get much more hypocritical than that ladies and gents, than for the liberals to lecture everyone about &quot;tone&quot; and &quot;respectful discourse&quot; all the while labeling their political opposition with such deragatory terms as &quot;tea bagger&quot; and slandering the movement with false, unsubstantiated, unspported by fact, assertions of violence.Especially given that time and time again, in incident after incident, it's been the leftists who become/became violent while protesting.Infact, during the entire term of former President Bush, these same liberals who are now so worried about violence, defended such things as assault and violence comitted by fellow liberals, in incidents such as throwing pies, vandalism to private property saying such actions comitted by these leftists, in their name, for their &quot;cause&quot; was defended as &quot;free speech&quot; and &quot;patriotism&quot;.
<b>John1735</b>	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	221	And that's not even taking into account, their attempted defense of the recent attack on persons leaving a republican fundraiser, by attempting to outright lie concerning the facts of the case.
<b>John1735</b>	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	221	Claiming first that it was not liberals who were there protesting which comitted the attack, and then falsely claiming that the attack was not politically motivated, eventhough the New Orleans police Department say's it was.See once again, we are all supposed to ignore the fact that it's by far, more often than not, these leftists who become violent in the face of opposition to their ideology.So the liberals can pretend that they're just the poor misunderstood victims.

Dispondent	openscandal	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	268	An experienced executive would also not allow themselves to be steamrolled by Congress, which it appears has happened to Obama since day one.

jthorp24	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	317	1.
jthorp24	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	317	They say &quot;that's not true.&quot; They deny the fact.2.
jthorp24	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	317	They change the subject.3.
jthorp24	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	317	They call us racist, sexist, etc.4.
jthorp24	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	317	They blame Bush.5.
jthorp24	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	317	They say you are ignorant to get out of an argument.
mertex	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	318	And since you didn't refute my CNN poll, I will assume you either didn't read it or didn't understand it.And you changed the subject - is that the way Reps/cons get out of an argument?So, where is your poll saying that Obama's ratings are going down - don't post one from back when Reps were making up lies about HCR and getting the whole country to believe those stupid lies - those polls have been replaced now with people that figured out the sky didn't fall after all and the world didn't end, like conservatives promised.
Yosh Shmenge	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	319	For some reason () Obama doesn't have his health scare program even beginning in earnest for four more years.
Yosh Shmenge	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	319	Funny, I thought we had such an emergency that his program couldn't be put off even a day more.That was then, I suppose.There is news about how the Obama care will actually cost more than promised (surprised) and how large corporations are going to end their having health care for their employees (swelling the ranks of those without, and raising costs even more).
Yosh Shmenge	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	319	So if the sky isn't falling, it's because the Obama health care isn't even running yet.Are you ignorant of the facts, or just disingenuous?
BFOJ	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	324	So in effect when one stays home their unvote went for the candidate that wins.

BFOJ	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	324	I'm speaking in general about non-voters.Each vote is important, many have fought and died for our privilege (not right) to vote and every election has consequences as has been and continues to be seen.

BFOJ	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	324	I suppose the problem is that there's so few of the earlier and too many of the latter.
BFOJ	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	324	We would even recognize a real statemen in this time and day?Though I can't think of any statesmen at this time, perhaps someone might offer a name or two of such.
SideTraKd	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	325	Portray it anyway you want to, I could no more stomach the idea of consenting to a McCain presidency than I could to Obama's.I made it very clear to my fellow Republicans before we even got close to the primaries that I would never support him, and would refuse to vote if they chose to nominate him.I would rather see a real liberal Democrat remind Americans of how bad they are, than put another RINO in the White House and have the majority of Americans continue to blame us for what are basically liberal policies.The differences between Obama and McCain were so minimal to me as to not be worthy of a choice.

mertex	Whaler17	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	392	His transcript at Yale, leaked to The New Yorker, shows that he was a solid C student.

mertex	Whaler17	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	392	(The anthropology class, however, was taught by Margaret Mead that year and was enormously popular because she offered among the easiest grades at Yale.)Mr. Bush was not much of a student of politics, for he earned only a 73 in Introduction to the American Political System and a 71 in Introduction to International Relations.
mertex	Whaler17	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	392	Few, if any, professors seem to have left a mark on him, or he on them.Several professors who taught him said he had simply been one student in a huge class.
mertex	Whaler17	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	392	As the historian John Morton Blum put it, &quot;I haven't the foggiest recollection of him.&quot; Erich Segal, who later met Mr. Gore at Harvard and based the main character in &quot;Love Story&quot; partly on him, taught a classical comedy course that Mr. Bush took, but Mr. Segal said he had no memory of him.The transcript indicates that in Mr. Bush's freshman year, the only year for which rankings were available, he was in the 21st percentile of his class, meaning that four-fifths of the students had better grades than he did.http://partners.nytimes.com/library/...900wh-bush.htm

BFOJ	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	399	And you still think Obama is Presidential material?
BFOJ	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	399	Why?

sallybrewno	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	400	Along the way he fixed up neglected roads, bridges and power plants, and funded school construction and internet access, helped round up the crooks who got us into all this economic trouble.
sallybrewno	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	400	He ended tax breaks for firms that outsource our jobs; he prevented tax cheats from hiding their money overseas and finally persuaded Swiss bankers to expose crooked depositors; he reformed the credit card industry, he ended protection of predatory credit card firms, and he signed the anti-fraud bill, won a Nobel Prize for getting the world back on track, on arms proliferation, the Middle East peace process, relations with the Muslim world, climate change, war crimes, torture, and diplomacy.
sallybrewno	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	400	He reengaged with world leaders and the international community, he improved America’s image internationally, he repaired bilateral relations with dozens of countries, he persuaded Pakistan to go after the Taliban, he improved our Cuba policy, and he freed prisoners in North Korea and Myanmar; showed his balls by putting more troops in Afghanistan and improving Afghanistan policy; he killed the Somali pirates, freed the American captain, and put the Navy in Somali waters; pulled troops out of Iraq and stopped the stop-loss system, he got body armor for our troops, he increased pay, benefits, medical care and housing for troops and veterans, he hired more military spouses; he improved conditions at military hospitals, he stopped the media blackout on war casualties and on the arrival of the coffins at Dover AFB, and he paid to bring families of soldiers to Dover when the coffins arrived; stopped the torture, and he directed the closure of Guantanamo and the secret prisons in Europe; cleaned up his predecessor’s blank-check defense spending: he overhauled military procurement, he blocked no-bid defense contracts, and he phased out unnecessary military programs like the F22 and missile defense; expanded health care for 4 million children, expanded vaccination programs, cut drug costs for seniors, saved hundreds of millions by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, led the fight against the swine flu, and stopped pharmacists from cutting women off from birth control.So, yeah, I think he can hack it.

BFOJ	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	408	You should remember in 2008 the man had no record to run on, people had this unrealistic belief in him, he may have been destined to be the first black President.But now the truth about him has come out, he has a record, his radical agenda has been exposed and white guilt is no longer a reason to vote for him.
BFOJ	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	408	More and more Americans are recognizing how bad he is for us to continue to live the American dream, to have the freedoms we took for granted and the proper role of the Federal Government.&quot;If the economy is improving or humming along?&quot; And just what has or is he doing to make that a reality?
BFOJ	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	408	Apparently you're still employed, haven't lost your home (or perhaps sucking at the teat of the government) otherwise you're in la-la land.&quot;The unemployement rate is decreasing or low?&quot; Have we come to a point that we accept a near 10% unemployment rate as the new norm?How anyone can still believe in this unman is beyond my human understanding.
BFOJ	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	408	It's kind of like trying to grasp the size of the universe, the mind cannot take it in.
BFOJ	Divine Wind	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	408	But reality will sink in, so there is hope for you and the others of your ilk.

BFOJ	Rampant.A.I.	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	409	The failure is that it's backward.

BFOJ	Rampant.A.I.	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	409	This is both good and bad as these coalitions tend to fall apart and the country undergoes change without any hope of stability.

BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	421	He's never had a high level job.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	421	Sure he's filled some positions, but not a real job so there is nothing to quit except being the butt of a joke.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	421	Biden can't be insulted, he is an insult.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	422	lol wut?!
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	422	There are people who are against reducing spending?
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	422	Seriously you live in another universe.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	422	No one is against reducing spending.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	422	They simply can't agree on what to cut.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	422	Democrats would like to see defense budgets cut and republicans would like to see social programs cut.Both have a lot of waste in them but the fact is we are paying for them NOW and we can spend the next thousand years debating what needs to be cut or we can actually pay for what we are spending now and sort it out quicker when people get pissed at how high their taxes are.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	423	lmao he's been a US senator since the 70s.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	423	What the hell are you talking about?!
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	424	You of the parallel universe, thinking that Democrats want to reduce spending.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	424	You've made my day...I say cut all federal spending except that which is necessary to to the health and security of this nation.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	424	And I don't mean Health insurance.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	425	You think being a Senator is a job?
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	425	What the hell are you thinking?
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	426	And what is unnecessary.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	426	There have been polls on this.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	426	Of all the big spending items not one thing can gain over 20&#37; approval for cutting.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	426	Meanwhile our deficit is getting higher and higher.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	426	We need to pay the bill now.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	426	Not wait until our bill gets smaller.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	427	There is just no talking to people like you...
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	428	Is there anyone on this planet who doesn't want to save money?
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	428	That's just a ridiculous notion that you think there are people that don't want to save money.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	429	They are paying the bill now, ever hear of taxes and the government printing money.Your response is kind of like the one about illegal immigration.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	429	I'll paraphase:Meanwhile the number of illegals is getting higher and higher.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	429	We need to stop the flow of illegal immigrants now.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	429	Not wait until those numbers get higher.See what I mean?
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	430	You're correct.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	430	People who've had a job know what I mean.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	430	And you don't think those Senators know they have a cushy position, terrific benefits, health insurance you'll never have, a pension beyond description, all expenses paid, and on an on.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	430	I know you're struggling to make sense of all this but to tell you the truth, the only thing left in my wallet now is cents, not sense.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	431	Again you are assuming democrats do not support securing the border.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	431	We do.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	431	We just don't support kicking people who have already established a life and family here out.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	432	I guarantee you've never had a job that held as much responsibility as a US senator.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	433	Wanting to save and actually saving are two different things.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	433	Guess how many families can save now?
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	433	How many even have a job, a home, a hope?No, times have changed.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	433	The unending pool of money that the government use to have (our money mind you) is no longer.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	433	It's credit all we have yet the government still continues to spend, spend, spend us into oblivion.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	433	Now if you have access to a gravy train, please share it with us.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	I agree.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	But we are talking about wants.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	Not dos.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	Both republicans and democrats have wants for what to cut.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	But both fail to make the cuts.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	The republicans consistently fail to make cuts to.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	Anyone and everyone will consistently fail to make cuts for as long as we are unwilling to make the sacrifice for what we are already spending and raise taxes to cover it.As long as Americans can still go shopping at the mall they don't really care about cutting spending.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	Like I sad...there isn't a single big ticket item that the American people broadly support cutting.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	Nothing gains over 20&#37; support for cutting.If we raised taxes and put a fire under American butts you can be sure we will pick something to cut and fast.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	No, I don't think Democrats want to secure the border, they want those new potential Democrat voters.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	So we should just willy-nilly let anyone cross over to establish a life and family here without regard to whether it's legal or not.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	They knew if beforehand that it was wrong, but they came anyway.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	Kind of like a criminal knowing what they are doing is wrong but not expecting to get caught and suffer the consequence.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	Perhaps you want to spend your hard earned (or is that hardly earned) money on them, but I don't.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	My preference to to help those American citizens and legal immigrants who have a need.You're all emotional, suggesting we want to kick people out.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	No, we want them to follow the laws of this land as you (I think) and I do.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	So stop with the crybaby tactic and be a man that wants to ensure the health and security of this nation.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	No different than what any country would want and expect.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	436	They are raising taxes as we write and the fire they are putting under American butts is what is stemming the tide of continued wasteful spending.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	436	No longer is spending the catch phrase, it's holding the line.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	436	You want your taxes raises, go for it.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	436	As for me I want the spending cut and cut NOW!
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	436	Our representatives are starting to get the message and you see how many of them are leaving congress and losing primaries.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	436	Yep, as it should be.You raise taxes, you increase spending, it's as simple as that.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	That's gotta be the most backward ass conspiracy theroy I've ever heard lol.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	How the hell are illegal immigrants going to vote?
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	They can't even become naturalized citizens if they are illegal.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	And what about the American citizen children of illegal immigrants?
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	Are we supposed to rip their parents away from them?
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	I fail to see how I'm being emotional.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	You're the one calling me a cry baby lol.The fact is yes they broke the law but they're here.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	And many of them have been here for decades.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	They've established a life here and it's completely inhumane to relocate them to a place they are no longer familiar with.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	Especially if they have children who are American citizens.I mean hey if they've been here for a year or two then yeah, deport them.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	But if they've been here for many years or they have children here then what's the point.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	Clearly they aren't hurting anyone by being here.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	I want to cut spending too.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	But I'm telling you it's not going to happen.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	You can say you want to all you want but it's not going to happen.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	No one cuts spending when they are living a comfortable life.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	People only cut spending when they are forced to.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	This is why Obama's pay-go law is such a good law.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	If we pass a spending bill then there should be revenue that goes with it.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	If we aren't making sacrifices for our high spending then there is no incentive to cut spending.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	So you can ride your high horse all you want pretending you're the only one who wants to cut spending.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	When in fact everyone wants to cut spending.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	We just can't agree on what to cut because none of us are actually sacrificing enough to feel we need to cut things we actually want to be able to spend money on.Let me ask you this.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	I want to see a cut in defense spending by 50%.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	Would you support this cut?
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	440	You're repeating yourself.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	440	You assume we support kicking people out of here.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	440	Again, they knew what they did was wrong before they did it, sounds like a planned crime to me. Suffer the consequences.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	440	Besides they have a home in the land they came from.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	440	How about you establishing a life and family in their homeland.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	440	A one for one swap.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	440	We keep one illegal, the other country will deal with you.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	441	Sure I have.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	441	Life and death for that matter.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	441	They care more about their life and pursuit of happiness than those you assume they care about.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	441	Typical rich representatives that care about the poor.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	441	Don't make me laugh.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	442	Duh!
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	442	Democrats want to legalize the illegal immigrant, this is how they'll get the vote.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	442	There are many, many American children living around the world to non-American parents.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	442	What's the big deal?
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	442	The problem is the parents came here illegally, remain here illegally, the children will do just fine with their parents elsewhere.Ok, I see a little movement on your part.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	442	How the heck are we suppose to know how long they lived here, they're illegal, no documentation?
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	442	Obviously many are hurting others here, look at the rise in crime rates in those areas swarming with illegals.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	442	I suppose you are ok with this since you probably live in a white only neighborhood.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	443	Life or death of hundreds of millions of people?
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	444	I don't want the government to force me (or tell me) how to spend my money, I certainly don't want to see taxes rise to help the government spend the money.

BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	444	No money, no spending.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	444	How about that?Defense is indeed something the Federal Government should be spending money on.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	444	It's about keeping this country safe and secure.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	444	Aside from a few specific domestic issues the government should not be in the business of providing that which amounts to welfare or feel good spending so they can stay in office.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	444	Go back, read the Constitution and other documents of our Founding Fathers.

TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	445	I just gave you an area to cut spending and you turned it down!
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	445	Why are you against cutting spending!
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	446	You referring to Senators?
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	446	I needed a good laugh.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	446	Thanks!
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	447	You only address part of my response.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	447	I did not say I wouldn't support defense spending, but 50%, that's what our enemies would like.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	447	I mentioned where I think the spending should be.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	447	But apparently you like to be taxed and don't care about continued spending.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	447	Mighty big of you to spend my money too.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	448	Yes.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	448	Senators make decisions that affect the lives of millions of Americans.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	448	Bad decisions on congress's part could lead to complete disasters if done incorrectly.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	448	They have more responsibility than you ever did.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	449	Cutting our defense by 50% would mean we would be spending more on defense than the next 8 countries combined.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	449	I think we'll be fine.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	450	Yes they do.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	450	It is they that approved the actions in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	450	More Americans have died as a result of their actions so it's on them, not me. They make bad decisions everyday that are complete disaster, note the new Health Care bill, the rampant spending, the bankruptcy they are leading us to (although I think we're already there).You go Obama (ex-Senator, soon to be ex-President).
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	451	We'd also be cutting our own throats, wouldn't have to wait for the terrorists to do so.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	451	Our defense is what keeps us safe and secure.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	451	You willing to give that up for the lavish spending on welfare and such?
SideTraKd	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	452	Cutting defense even by 50% would not do a whole lot for us, apart from the fact that it is one of the few things left in the budget that the federal government is actually constitutionally mandated to provide.Our entire security spending for FY2010 is $844 billion, and only part of that is defense spending.
onalandline	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	453	Agree.
onalandline	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	453	A strong military/national defense is what maintains our way of life.
onalandline	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	453	Sure the economy sucks, but it sucks everywhere right now.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	454	Our biggest enemy right now doesn't even have an air force.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	454	Their idea of a good strategy is strapping a bomb to their chest and walking into a mall.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	454	It's absolute paranoia to think spending more than the next 8 top military COMBINED is not enough.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	454	Absolute paranoia.
TheTaoOfBill	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	455	Defense counts for 19% of our budget.
TheTaoOfBill	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	455	It's the 2nd largest area of spending.It's not the end all solution but to pretend it wouldn't have a serious impact on our budget is ridiculous.
Iriemon	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	457	That, plus getting out of Iraq and Afghanistan, would cut expenditures by about $450 billion a year.
Iriemon	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	457	That's a lot, maybe even a whole lot.
BFOJ	BestViewedWithCable	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	458	There won't be any other guy (or gal).
BFOJ	BestViewedWithCable	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	458	You've excluded everyone.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	459	CBO numbers for 2020:http://www.cbo.gov/Social programs account for 48%, defense a mere 15%.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	460	Social programs benefit the economy.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	461	To an extent, but without a strong defense our security would be compromised and you can forget about social programs for that money will go to things that won't benefit the economy or the people.Look around the world, see where in totalitarian governments where the money goes.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	461	Defense, little left for the people.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	461	So in that light, you can see our defense spending is negligible.
catalinacat	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	462	Are you sure he's going to run?
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	463	Are you saying you don't think we'd be secure spending more than the next 8 top militaries combined?
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	463	Because that's how much we'd be spending if we cut defense spending in half.I mean do we really need as many bases in Europe as we have?
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	463	No one in Europe is our enemy.

TheTaoOfBill	Whaler17	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	465	Maybe if you were talking about High School.
TheTaoOfBill	Whaler17	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	465	But certainly college.
TheTaoOfBill	Whaler17	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	465	And certainly not Harvard Law School.

BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	466	I would say we would not be secure.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	466	We are not in Europe and South Korea and elsewhere because they are our enemies.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	466	We are there for many purposes.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	466	Including having our forces around the world ready for defending our home country from afar to keep our enemies away and also for the defense of countries that we count as allies.Personally, I'd like to see our armed forces return to America and have a much more powerful Navy and long-range Air Force.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	466	A strong missle defense (and offense, if needed) and much more reliance on satellite techology.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	466	I'd like to say it'd be nice to rely on allies who have a powerful military but at this time that is not the case and many of those allies are falling prey to radical Islam and new government structures that will turn against us, as some have already.You are naive if you think letting down our defense will be a good thing for American and it's people.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	466	You are falling for the lies of the Left and our other enemies.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	467	I thought &quot;very well rounded person&quot; included common sense, experience and good judgment as well as some semblence of strength.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	467	You don't obtain these characteristics from college, certainly not Harvard Law School.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	468	I didn't say you gain them.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	468	I said it implies you have them.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	468	You don't get through Harvard Law School with a 4.0 with no common sense.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	469	I said nothing about letting our defense down.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	469	I want our defense more efficient.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	469	We don't have a single enemy that would fight us in Europe.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	469	Not a one.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	469	Our biggest and most capable enemy is North Korea.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	469	North Korea is not going to fight us in Europe.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	469	And if an enemy in Europe arrises we have allies there that would allow us to build a base at any time.Our European bases are nothing but WW2 and Cold War relics.
TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	469	They are useless wastes of money.

BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	470	If so, you'd eat your words.
BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	470	Look around, especially at Obama and his administration.

BFOJ	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	557	I like most Americans would long to have had a third term for Bush rather than what we have now that tries to pass as a President.
BFOJ	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	557	President of what country?
BFOJ	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	557	Certainly not the U.S.
onalandline	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	558	I agree.
onalandline	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	558	Obama makes a mockery of this country and the Presidency.
onalandline	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	558	He is the most anti-American politician in Washington.
onalandline	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	558	He bashed our country on his World Apology Tour, and now he sides with foreign leaders against the U.S. What's next, a Dictator Summit?
onalandline	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	558	He's going to invite Ahmadinejad, Chavez, and Il to the White House to find ways he could improve himself.

BFOJ	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	559	He stutters more than Porky Pig and doesn't have a prayer when it comes to winging it.
BFOJ	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	559	Even Bush puts the unman to shame.Bush may have not been the greatest orator, but he was a man who obviously loved and cared about America and its people, showed strength in the face of our enemies and didn't remind us everyday that it's all about him (as Obama does).Obama does quite well doing what???
BFOJ	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	559	One and a half-years in office and Obama and his henchmen/women have totally run this country into the ground with no upswing in sight.
BFOJ	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	559	If Bush or McCain were in office we would have already seen a recovery, North Korea wouldn't be the issue it is today and Israel would know it wouldn't have to go it alone.

onalandline	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	561	He didn't try to use words to BS his way around.
onalandline	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	561	Obama's ability to speak well, with a TelePrompTer and a speech written by a twenty-something year old, just enables him to deliver the BS to the sheeple so that they buy into what he is saying.
onalandline	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	561	Speaking well does not imply knowledge and competence.

TheTaoOfBill	NewSmirkingChimp	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	562	It's a really stupid game.

TheTaoOfBill	NewSmirkingChimp	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	562	So it's not exactly the wisest path to take for a conservative.Focus on the policies.Of which Sarah Palin has few good ones.

mertex	NewSmirkingChimp	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	566	I suppose you thought Bush's pronunciation of &quot;nukelar&quot; was right up there with Palin's lack of reading abilities!

mertex	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	567	And, Obama didn't have to go to &quot;debate camp&quot; to learn what foreign policy meant.
mertex	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	567	For conservatives it doesn't.
mertex	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	567	They are satisfied with a hockey mom, who doesn't read newspapers, didn't know her own president's doctrine, and writes notes on her hands so she can remember what the topic is! That is why they resent Obama, they don't understand what he is saying - goes over their heads.
mertex	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	568	I wouldn't have used such a nice word.

mertex	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	569	Interesting, for someone that refers to Christianity so often in his/her posts.
mertex	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	569	I guess there a lot of delusional conservatives who still think &quot;most&quot; Americans were fond of Bush as we kicked him out of office and with a low rating to boot!
mertex	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	569	I don't doubt it, because it appears that conservatives don't care what state they put the country in, whether it is a depression, recession, or toilet, as long as they have their party of &quot;no&quot; at the helm.
mertex	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	569	And, they continue to support their leaders, when they see that they are going against everything that is helpful to Americans.

BFOJ	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	577	It was his nomination that started the run on Wall Street and Main Street as everyone with sense moved their money to safer environs because of their concern for an Obama Presidency and his radical ideas.

Shiva_TD	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	595	Measuring in trillions of dollars is somewhat hard to determine for several reasons.
Shiva_TD	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	595	First and foremost is that while a president does have influence the budget is actually established by Congress and not the president.
Shiva_TD	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	595	Next is the fact that the 2009 budget is a Bush budget and not an Obama budget although Obama did add some spending to it.
Shiva_TD	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	595	By comparison though in 8 years President Bush doubled the national debt and even with projected average deficits of almost a trillion dollars per year President Obama will not double the national debt that he inherited from the Bush adminstration even if he remains in office for 8 years.

frodly	Shiva_TD	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	596	What independents actually like and don't like is simple.
frodly	Shiva_TD	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	596	There are many politically sophisticated independents, but most independents are not.

frodly	Shiva_TD	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	596	So for the most part independents dislike taxes on themselves.
frodly	Shiva_TD	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	596	Whether they are ok with taxes on other people is more mixed, but taxes on themselves are always opposed.
frodly	Shiva_TD	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	596	They are in favor of government programs that they can clearly tell benefit them.
frodly	Shiva_TD	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	596	So they tend to like social security, medicaid, etc. They tend to dislike programs that clearly directly benefit other people, but not themselves.
frodly	Shiva_TD	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	596	Most don't care about the drug war, but the ones who do are probably relatively evenly split, with people opposed to the drug war probably a slight majority.

frodly	Shiva_TD	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	596	They may agree with a few of those points, but they are certainly not in complete agreement on any of those points.

Shiva_TD	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	601	Most independents that I have heard from want a balanced budget without tax increases and that would mandate cuts in both military and entitlement budgets because there is no other way to achieve a balanced budget.
Shiva_TD	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	601	People are delusional if they believe that cutting $15-20 billion in pork barrel spending will eliminate a trillion dollar annual deficit and I don't believe that independents are that delusional.
Shiva_TD	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	601	They know what needs to be cut even though they are probably calling for cuts in programs they support in principle.

frodly	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	629	Because of the electoral college, Obama will get my vote no matter what I do, because he will, without question, win Illinois.Not only will he win Illinois, but he will win reelection as well.

frodly	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	629	But much more importantly, Obama will win because by 2012, the economy will have rebounded.
frodly	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	629	Now that simply has to do with the nature of the business cycle, but because of the nature of politics Obama will claim the credit, and he will win reelection.
frodly	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	629	Another important reason Obama will win, is because Republicans are REALLY (*)(*)(*)(*)!!

frodly	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	630	It was 301 billion.
frodly	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	630	If adjusted for inflation, that would be 495 billion in todays dollars.
frodly	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	630	Defense spending in W. Bush's last budget was 680 billion.
frodly	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	630	Significantly more than the spending was the last year of the cold war!!So yes, if you discount reality I suppose that couldn't be more truthful.
frodly	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	630	But being the crazy liberal that I am, I like to reference reality when deciding how truthful a statement is.

Shiva_TD	Brandon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	699	I received the same non-response from my senators when I question them about &quot;legal tender&quot; laws and pointed out that Article I of the Constitution only allowed Congress to &quot;Coin Money&quot; (not print currency) in Section 8 and prohibited any State from making &quot;any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts&quot; in Section 10.
Shiva_TD	Brandon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	699	While we don't have a State income tax in WA I am waiting for the day when I get a check from the WA government, perhaps from an overpayment of property taxes, so I can go to the State Treasury and demand payment in gold or silver in compliance with Article I Section 10 of the US Constitution.
Shiva_TD	Brandon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	699	I wonder why no one has done this before?
Shiva_TD	Brandon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	699	Perhaps they have and I am merely unaware of it but it certainly reflects that the &quot;legal tender&quot; laws are unconstitutional IMO.
Shiva_TD	Brandon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	699	If the States can only make payment in gold and silver under the Constitution then the federal government which is subject to the rule of the States cannot do that which the States cannot do.

mertex	REDRUM	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	702	The blue dog democrat that side with the Republicans are those that are more interested in keeping their jobs in conservative infested states, than what is good for the country, and they are in the minority, just like the reps.Calling Obama socialist is a phrase coined by Bush Limbaugh, repeated by the GOP Media, Fox News and company, and all the conservatives who have no earthly idea what true socialism is, but find it comforting to make that assumption about Obama, because that way they don't have to expose their true reasons, prejudice ad bigotry.Socialists claim calling Obama a socialist is ABSURDObama's not Socialist, I should knowObama's tax policy not Socialist
Brandon	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	703	Rush Limbaugh calls socialist and communists evil people and they want to destroy &quot;this&quot; country, yet whenever he defines socialism and communism it's always psuedo-Stalinism.

Tarheeler	iAWESOME	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	710	If you are the polar opposite of the majority of his policies today, it's a fair bet you're going to the polar opposites of the majority of his policies come election time.
frodly	Tarheeler	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	711	He has already adopted much of the &quot;Republican&quot; platform.
frodly	Tarheeler	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	711	Most notably on foreign policy issues.
frodly	Tarheeler	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	711	Where he has changed the way the president talks, but has done very little to change the way the president acts.
frodly	Tarheeler	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	711	He has also failed to pass meaningful financial reform, and appointed Timothy Geithner, a man who played a major role in the Bush administration, as his treasury secretary.
frodly	Tarheeler	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	711	He has obviously deviated on many issues as well, but the narrative some right wing fantasy story tellers(aka fox news and Am radio) have been propagating, about Obama's radical agenda is completely detached from reality.
frodly	Tarheeler	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	711	There is more than enough there for any rational and independent minded conservative to like.
frodly	Tarheeler	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	711	They may not like many things, specifically the increased spending(though it didn't bother them under Bush), but there are many issues on which they could come to agreement.
frodly	Tarheeler	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	711	It just happens that Obama sparks an irrational hatred among most people on the right, and that causes them to invent reasons to hate him more than reality could ever dictate.
Brandon	JazePentz	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	712	You think Obama is any different than Bush?
Brandon	JazePentz	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	712	Seriously...
Tarheeler	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	713	I agree that he's similar to Bush, particularly in foreign affairs.
Tarheeler	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	713	As for the rest, it's extremely debatable.
Tarheeler	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	713	Bush might have been a republican, but few would seriously call him conservative.Stating that he's adopted a republican platform is a stretch of enormous proportions.
Tarheeler	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	713	Not being able to carry out his original promises doesn't equal adoption of the opposite stance.
Tarheeler	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	713	Most new presidents fail miserable when it comes to delivering on their campaign promises.You seem to have pretty strong feelings there, frodly.
Tarheeler	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	713	Maybe conservatives aren't the only ones with an irrational hatred.
Tarheeler	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	713	Just because someone doesn't agree with Obama doesn't mean he's being called radical.
Tarheeler	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	713	You seem to be under the impression that the hatred for the opposing team in something new; it's not.
Tarheeler	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	713	The democrats were absolutely rabid towards Bush.
frodly	Tarheeler	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	714	I dislike Obama as much as bush.
frodly	Tarheeler	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	714	I simply reject the conservative position being taken of late, that Obama is the worst most evil politician in the world, when the reality is, he is just like pretty much all politicians.
frodly	Tarheeler	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	714	I should say he is like all Democratic and Republican politicians, which means lacking in true principles and only loyal to the interests that fund his campaign and lobby him on a daily basis.
fpolitics	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	715	Bush was much worse then Obama, but that still does not make Obama good enough for me to vote for him.
Shiva_TD	fpolitics	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	717	Obviously most Americans also considered McCain/Palin worse than Obama and did vote for Obama which is why he was elected.The 2012 elections will probably hinge on the same fundamental decision.
Shiva_TD	fpolitics	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	717	Obama maybe bad but is he worse than who the Republicans will run against him.
Shiva_TD	fpolitics	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	717	On a side note if we compared McCain and Palin I would state that McCain was superior to Palin (even though he is a dinosaur of politics) and the Palin choice obviously hurt McCain in the election.
Shiva_TD	fpolitics	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	717	The Republicans would certainly reflect absolute stupidity to run the worst part of their 2008 ticket as their 2012 presidential candidate.
Shiva_TD	fpolitics	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	717	Hopefully they will actually nominate a good candidate but it is doubtful based upon past history.
Shiva_TD	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	719	One of the problems we have is that elections are not carried by voting for candidates so much as voting against candidates.
Shiva_TD	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	719	I believe Obama was elected with the support of independents who were fundamentally voting against the McCain/Palin ticket.
Shiva_TD	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	719	It was a choice between &quot;two evils&quot; and the independents selected the lessor of the two evils.
Shiva_TD	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	719	Americans will probably be faced with the same choice in 2012.
onalandline	fpolitics	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	721	I don't think so, but you are entitled to your opinion.
onalandline	fpolitics	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	721	Obama has done more damage in 1 1/2 years than Bush did in all 8.
Shiva_TD	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	722	Let's see, the entire economy was imperiled by the Bush adminstration's lack of attention and neglect of the United States while off waging wars based upon unsupported and often false allegations which resulted in as many as one million innocent people dying while also leaving the government with over a trillion dollar budgetary deficit in 2009 and having doubled the entire national debt in only 8 years.
Shiva_TD	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	722	I'm not a fan of Obama's but he is going to have to do quite a bit more the equal the damage done to the United States by the prior adminstration.
TheTaoOfBill	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	723	I really can't see how he's the same as Bush.
TheTaoOfBill	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	723	He's working to get DADT repealed.
TheTaoOfBill	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	723	He passed a major stimulus bill that Bush would have never touched.
TheTaoOfBill	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	723	And he completely reformed healthcare in a way Bush never would have done.
TheTaoOfBill	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	723	Not to mention he has a more sensible tax plan and his policies are actually improving the economy rather than destroying it.He's not perfect.
TheTaoOfBill	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	723	But he's leagues above Bush.

frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	Instead he passed a mandate that required all people to give more money to private health care companies.
frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	He has failed to stop rendition, close Guantanamo, stop torture, get us out of Iraq, open talks with Iran, etc. I don't necessarily agree with all of those issues(guantanamo for example is just political football, even if we closed it we just would have moved the people somewhere else without actually changing anything substantial), but if he had lived up to those promises it would show me that he is not just any other politician.
frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	He of course has not.I now realize is it is all political theater.

frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	They simply need to have fox news distract right wingers from the legitimate issues facing this country, and all other media sources to distract all other people from the legitimate problems facing this country.

Dware	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	733	You are out of your mind man.Name one president who passed (borrowed from the chinese) a 800 BILLION dollar &quot;stimulus&quot; and passed a 4 TRILLION dollar healthcare welfare plan for fat lazy poor people to get free drugs.Osama is by far the most EXTREME lefty to ever step foot in the White House.And look what happens..10% unemployment and 6 million lost jobs
glen65	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	734	Just because he hasn't come through on various things promised doesn't necessarily mean he leans less to the left than previouslythought.
glen65	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	734	It just means that he has failed to accomplish what was promised.
candycorn	Dware	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	735	Yeah, you're right, Bush only spent 700 Billion in his last days and spent 11 trillion largely on a war of choice in Iraq.
TheTaoOfBill	Dware	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	736	Bush passed a 1.8 trillion dollar stimulus comprised completely of corporate tax cuts.
TheTaoOfBill	Dware	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	736	also his 600 dollar tax rebate stimulus cost about 150 billion.
TheTaoOfBill	Dware	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	736	Reagan's tax cuts cost us even more than Bush's as a percentage of our GDP.
Dware	candycorn	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	737	The ENTIRE war for 7 years while Bush was in office was 600 Billion dollars, for 7 years of war.Where in the hell are you getting 11 Trillion dollars brah?

frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	741	I will either not vote, or vote for some independent liberal.
frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	741	I would vote for nader, but I don't think he will run again.
frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	741	Hopefully some one takes his place, and I will vote for them.
Agent Zero	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	742	I'll end up voting for somebody that'll get like 0.3% of the vote, but at least I'll feel better.
Agent Zero	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	742	God knows I'm not voting Republican.
frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	743	Yep same here.
frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	743	I will vote for some one who gets almost no votes, but I will feel better than voting for Obama or any other Democrat, and I would never vote for a Republican either.
glen65	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	744	Reagan's tax cuts did no such thing.
glen65	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	744	It was spending increases on thepart of a democrat controlled congress.
glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	745	How will assisting in your own sides loss make you feel better?
Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	746	If Obama runs again, I think he will win.
Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	746	But independent of this, why should I vote for anybody for any other reason than because I agree with them?
glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	747	Obama hasn't really changed his philosophical stance on the issues, what's&quot;not&quot; to agree with?
Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	748	I would have voted for him in 2008 if I was old enough to.
Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	748	He ran to the left of where he's been during his time in office.
Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	748	I don't think that's debatable.
glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	749	I most certainly is debatable,Just because he has failed to come through on certaincampaign promises doesn't mean he's changed his philisophicalstances.
glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	749	It simply means he failed to come through as promised.
Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	750	It's not that he hasn't come through, it's how he goes about not coming through, ya dig?
Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	750	He's too willing to compromise to the Nth degree with a party that will vote against everything he or the Democrats propose, a party that has a significant portion that believes he is a Socialist and/or he's not even a citizen of this country.
glen65	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	751	Obama will receive your vote again.When the election finally gets here you'll realize even more just how important your vote is, and will not want to waste it on some nobody candidate.
glen65	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	751	You will then hold your noseand hit the switch for Obama once again.
candycorn	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	752	Wouldn't it be good to see him push for his policies even when he doesn't have the votes at the time when the bill is introduced?
candycorn	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	752	I totally agree with your post on his being pragmatic.
candycorn	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	752	However, there is a time to go with the crowd and there is a time to lead.
candycorn	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	752	I haven't seen him lead much.
glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	753	Compromise?
glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	753	He could care less what the republicans want.What happened with health care should be plentyevidence of that.
Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	754	They threw in a bunch of amendments I do recall.
glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	755	Those amendments mean little to nothing in overall scheme of things.What's more important is that none of the republicans voted for it.
Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	756	They weren't going to vote for it no matter what he proposed.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	757	I guarantee you that I won't.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	758	No, it means his rhetoric does not match his action.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	758	I don't care what Obama says he believes, I don't care what his philosophical stances are, I care what his actions are.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	758	His actions are unacceptable.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	758	For me to forgive those actions because I agree with many of the things he says would be very stupid.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	No what is important is that there was no public option, and there was a mandate.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	A mandate that is basically a giant handout to health care providers.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	There has also been no significant financial reform.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	No further environmental reform.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	No comprehensive progressive energy bill.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	The Republicans voted against it as political theater.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	They spent a year convincing their followers that obama was an evil socialist, and that health care reform was an example of evil socialism.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	It would have been impossible for them to have then voted for the bill.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	It also perpetuates the myth that there is some fundamental difference between the 2 parties.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	Both parties are controlled by the same special and corporate interests, and persuaded by the same lobbyists on a daily basis.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	It is the interests of those groups both parties represent, not any overarching ideology.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	Why would I vote for one party over the other, when the outcomes on every important issue are going to be pretty much the same.
glen65	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	760	Even if that were true, so what?
glen65	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	760	The democrats managed to win a super majority and the republicans didn't &quot;and still don't&quot; have the power to stop anything.
Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	761	They don't have to as long as the Democrats' own majority does that for them.
Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	761	All the GOP has to do is vote no.
glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	762	What ever direction the GOP votes right now is irrelevant.They simply don't have the numbers to stop the democrats.
Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	763	The Democrats stop the Democrats.
Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	763	That's the point.
glen65	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	764	You're kind of missing the point,It being said that his recent actions (or lack thereof) is proof that he has all of the sudden shifted right philosophically.
glen65	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	764	I believe when it comes to his ideology he is as liberal as he ever was.
glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	765	If the process gets stopped up with the number of democratscurrently in office then you need to focus on what wrong with them,not the republicans.
Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	766	I am.

frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	767	That supports my position, it does not weaken it.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	767	Democrats had a super majority for almost a year.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	767	They could have gotten a public option, real financial reform, reformed social security in a liberal fashion, improved the welfare state, etc. What did they do instead?
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	767	They got almost nothing done in that year, and then blamed Republicans for stopping them, when as you pointed out, Republicans had no means by which to stop them.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	767	So they are full of (*)(*)(*)(*).
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	767	Why would I vote for them?
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	768	That is because your belief is clearly based on irrational partisanship.
frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	768	If you instead based your beliefs on reality, your beliefs would quickly change.
frodly	Sadistic-Savior	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	770	Does that mean yes then?
frodly	Sadistic-Savior	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	770	Or is it the same as no, which would then make me think you could just use the no option available....

jthorp24	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	791	I want Obama to fail as well.
jthorp24	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	791	It's only 3 minutes, please listen, he gives the perfect example.
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	792	That's right.
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	792	I don't like Obama's policies so I want the economy to fail because that will help him be defeated.
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	792	If a couple million more Americans lose their jobs, their savings, and their homes, that's OK as long as it leads to a Republican victory.
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	792	We see that attitude from a number of conservatives.Very patriotic.
jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	793	Did you even watch the video?
jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	793	I don't want this country to turn socialist, Obama succeeding means this.
jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	793	Why would I want that?
jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	793	That's not America.
jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	793	I don't care if you think I'm patriotic or not, I'm way more of an American than you will ever be.
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	794	Sure.
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	794	If the economy grows and is successful, then Obama succeeds.
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	794	Which Rush and his acolytes are against (because he might raise their taxes and he'd have to buy a smaller mansion).
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	794	Thus he wants the economy to fail, even if millions more Americans lose their jobs and homes, because then Obama fails.
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	794	Which is why Rush and the other Murdoch mouthpieces constantly emphaisize the negative about the economy and ignore the positives.
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	794	They know that if they can help create less confidence in the economy, that will help drag it down.

jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	796	He wasn't talking about the economy.
jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	796	The economy is going to fail under Obama regardless because he has no idea what he is doing.
jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	796	It's more about socialism/communism.
jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	796	We don't want the government having more control and telling us what to do!
jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	796	We would rather see higher tax rates than that.
jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	796	We want our freedoms in the great capitalistic society.
jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	796	Any American who wants the government controlling more things in the private sector is just wrong and completely un-american.
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	798	Turn on Rush on any given day and he is constantly talking about how badly the economy is doing.
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	798	IMO, if you feel that way, the patriotic and American thing to do would be to try to elect representatives who share your view and you can repeal the health care and deprive those tens of millions of Americans of health care coverage and everything will be hunky dory for you again like it was.But hoping the economy goes to the (*)(*)(*)(*)can so Obama fails while millions lose their jobs and homes is not.
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	798	In my opinion.

mertex	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	801	If Obama fails, that means his policies have put the country in jeopardy.

mertex	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	801	Why is it so hard for conservatives to understand that?
mertex	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	801	There is no failure for Obama without the entire country failing.

mertex	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	801	The man is an idiot.

jthorp24	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	803	Actually Obama is an idiot.
jthorp24	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	803	He does the opposite of what the public wants on every topic.
jthorp24	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	803	Rush can't harm the country, Obama can and he is.

EvilWriter	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	834	If she wins the Republican Primary (which I admit, is disturbingly possible,) then Obama's win in 2012 is practically assured.
EvilWriter	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	834	Heck, if Palin's his opponent, I'll be voting for him.Ron Paul... that's trickier.
EvilWriter	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	834	He's got a good grassroots movement, and he actually uses the internet (as do his followers).
EvilWriter	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	834	The problem is, the Republicans want to tank him hard.
EvilWriter	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	834	The fact that he's an actual conservative hurts him here.
EvilWriter	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	834	He criticizes his own party as much as he does the Democrats (indeed, I found out today while watching a YouTube clip of an interview with Ron Paul that he expressed the same sentiment that I express all the time.
EvilWriter	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	834	Granted it was an old interview, so he probably used it first.
EvilWriter	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	834	The Republicans were brought in to fix things, and they just made things worse.
EvilWriter	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	834	So the Democrats were brought in to fix things, and they did just what they said they would: increase spending and taxes.)But I don't think Paul has a chance.
EvilWriter	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	834	He'll have the establishment of both parties against him.
EvilWriter	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	834	Not to mention the media (or specifically Fox News) hates him.

jthorp24	EvilWriter	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	836	I really like Paul.
jthorp24	EvilWriter	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	836	I think he will be able to get quite a few liberal votes for president if he was able to win the republican primary.

Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	886	So far he is though.

Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	888	Social Security in 1983, and Deficit Reduction Act 1984
Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	888	I agree.
Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	888	I supported Clinton because she was the one who was most serious about this issue and had the best plan to address the deficits.

The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	889	I gave you a link to tax rates.
The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	889	I believe you are confusing tax revenues with tax rates.
The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	889	Show me where personal income tax rates went up.
The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	889	I'm not saying they didn't.
The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	889	I just can't find it.

Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	890	I agree.It can be a good idea to spend your way out of a recession/depression cycle, however.
Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	890	I didn't say personal income tax rates went up.SS tax rates when up about 20%, from 5% to 6%http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/taxRates.htmlThe 1984 act was a landry list of tax code changes.The effects are summarized here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReaganomicsThis link also notes a 1982 tax increase as well:http://www.capitalgainsandgames.com/...-tax-increasesMcCain may not have been a great candidate, but he had far more credibility on the spending issue than any of the democrats.[/quote]
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	Really?
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	So in your mind, 15% unemployment is preferable to a larger deficit and debt?
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	The largest problem with that argument, is that when you have a recession or a depression, you will lose large amounts of revenue anyways.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	You could say, we need to cut spending in response to those decreases in revenue, but that would lead to very undesirable economic outcomes.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	We could also raise taxes to make up for the loss in revenue, again the problem is that will also lead to undesirable economic outcomes.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	So how do you deal with the problem?
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	The answer is, it is very difficult in our current political climate.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	It isn't very difficult solution either, but political posturing makes sane economic decisions almost impossible.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	What some one with some knowledge of economics would say, is that you balance the budget over the business cycle, not on a year to year basis.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	Which means spending and tax policy should fluctuate.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	When their is a recession or a depression, you raise spending and cut taxes, which then stimulates the economy.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	When the economy is booming, you cut spending and raise taxes.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	The economy can handle those changes in times of prosperity, and then you make up for the deficits that are accrued during tough economic times.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	The problem is our economic policy is not particularly rational.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	Neither side ever cuts spending during good economic times, and Republicans oppose tax hikes at all times.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	That makes conducting policy in a reasonable way, meaning balancing the budget over the business cycle, almost impossible.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	Instead we have Republicans who want to cut taxes, without actually enacting spending cuts, all while the economy is strong.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	And democrats who want to raise taxes, but want to do so even when it is economically inadvisable.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	It is economic posturing, and it is very bad for the country.
The12thMan	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	893	Nice leap of logic.
The12thMan	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	893	I believe that Barack's spending spree cost jobs and prevented growth.
The12thMan	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	893	IMO, it has changed a slow recovery into a stagnate one.
The12thMan	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	893	Do the math.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	894	No, I am not making a leap in logic.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	894	I was asking you a hypothetical question.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	894	I was not claiming that without increased spending, we would have 15&#37; unemployment, though I feel confident it would be higher.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	894	I am asking a simple hypothetical and philosophical question about the importance of combating unemployment measured against the importance of combating debt.
The12thMan	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	895	The question does not make sense.
The12thMan	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	895	The spending bill hurt the recovery, IMO.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	896	The question makes perfect sense.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	896	Despite your beliefs, the idea that government spending stimulates the economy is not very controversial among economists.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	896	It is widely accepted to be true(though a minority does exist that questions that fact).
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	896	You may believe that the stimulus did not do enough to justify it's costs, but to claim it hurt recovery, is first of all unprovable, and second of all actually a leap of logic on your part.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	896	What evidence do you have to support your claim that the stimulus hurt the recovery?
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	896	What economic reasoning do you have, if no evidence exists?
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	896	Simply stating you believe something, without offering an explanation for why that belief exists, does not make much sense.

FLEX YOUR HEAD!	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	899	The only change is the change in your pocket that amounts to your life savings after being robbed by the capitalist class while Obama was picking his butt and being taught by Bill Clinton how to be the black Bill Clinton who himself was the democratic Ronald Reagan.Real change would be De-Reaganization.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	901	You clearly do not understand how the unemployment rate is determined.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	901	It has nothing to do with collecting unemployment benefits or not.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	901	It has to do with actively seeking employment vs not seeking employment.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	901	There are some people who do want to work, but are not seeking work, who are not in the work force, but how do you determine that number?
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	901	It is impossible, so basically you or some one else, just made that number up.
The12thMan	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	902	Frodly, there are people who believe that unemployment benefits are job creators too.

frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	The current economic crisis is not a supply problem, it is a matter of insufficient demand.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	Government spending boosts aggregate demand, therefore boosting the economy.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	Not only that, but unemployment insurance undoubtedly stimulates the economy.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	There is no doubt that it also offers a work disincentive, but in economic downturns, that disincentive is pretty irrelevant.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	People are not out of work at the moment, because they get unemployment insurance, and therefore have no reason to look for work.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	They are out of work, because the housing bubble burst, and we had a large economic downturn.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	Removing or reducing unemployment benefits might cause a few people to get jobs they are most likely overqualified for, but the reality is we would till have millions of people who cannot find work!!
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	What do you do with those people?
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	If the government gives them unemployment benefits, they will spend that money, thereby stimulating the economy.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	It isn't that complicated either.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	Unemployed people use the income they receive from the government, which then increases demand, consumption, etc. Which then can create jobs.
frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	While there is strong evidence to suggest it is a disincentive to work, it also certainly creates jobs for others!!

The latest total includes $205 billion in spending and $119 billion in tax cuts.
Surveybob	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	913	Overall, just over 40 percent of the about $800 billion stimulus package has entered the economy.You can track stimulus spending by agency on our interactive Stimulus Progress Bar.

Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	917	So I think we can afford a fraction more of that.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	917	But I certainly agree, Obama needs to raised taxes and trim spending to get the deficits down.

Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	920	They may have created lots of jobs, its just that the number of jobs being lost from the recession was greater until recently.2) Tax cuts won't create more jobs in the near term if those who receive the tax cuts don't spend the money and instead save it or use it to pay down debt, as was happening in this recession.
Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	920	That's why tax cuts are not a panacea and don't work as well as direct spending for creating jobs in a recession.

Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	948	A poll of voters released today.The question,In the NEXT [2012] Presidential election, would you vote for Obama or &quot;A Republican.&quot; Not this Republican or that Republican, just &quot;A Republican.&quot;The result?A Republican 42%Obama 37%obummer, cannot even beat a 'generic' Republican.I'd bet if it was against, &quot;Another Democrat?&quot; obummer would lose that one too.Had they asked, &quot;An Independent?&quot;obummer would have gotten blown off the board.

T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	951	Look at his website, or the website I previously posted, or the library of Congress's website.
T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	951	This is and always has been Democratic policy.
T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	951	Again, always has been Democratic policy, your saying he's a bad man for following his own party's policy.
T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	951	Before he was elected, President Bush increased our debt to 10.3 trillion, today it is 13 trillion... far less increase.

T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	951	Again, check the above website.

mertex	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	952	That they don't want to extend unemployment benefits to those that are hurting and accusing them of not looking for jobs, is just heartless.

TheTaoOfBill	naturalist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	958	In otherwords you just said the government agency responsible for counting unemployment rates is wrong about how unemployment rates are counted.Do you enjoy being laughably wrong?
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	NO, it was NOT a FOX News poll.FOX news, that you mindless liberals love to call Faux News, is burying what used to be the main stream media.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	FOX continues to rise in ratings [even before BO] while NBC, CNN, ABC, and CBS plummet.

Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	FOX presents news, not news they like or dislike, THE NEWS.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	The old, tired, failing, networks are now nothing but advertising agencies for the liberal left.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	They no longer KNOW what news is, and they can't figure out why they are failing across the board.Watch FOX and you'll be shocked to find that Bill O'Rielly is as strong an Obama defender as ANYONE in the old media.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	From the beginning of the BHO reign, O'Rielly has constantly said, &quot;Wait and see.&quot; &quot;Give him a chance.&quot; &quot;Obama is a very smart man.&quot;On the other hand, Glenn Beck thinks and says BHO is a horror.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	That is presenting 2 sides of a story.Throughout the broadcast day FOX has on STAUNCH Democrats and near and far left liberals.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	They give them a pulpit and let them present their ideology.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	The lamestream media USED to do that, now they don't.On Glenn Beck,,,,,No one in the administration, or on the left has PROVED anything that Beck says to be a lie.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	And he challenges them all to do so regularly.The left CLAIMS he's lying, but not once have they been able to say, &quot;Here is the fact proving Beck was lying.&quot; Beck PROVES the administration is lying on an almost daily basis.FOX presents BOTH sides, the rest present the liberal view ONLY.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	FOX prospers, the rest slowly sink.Keep calling them Faux News, they are laughing at your foolishly closed mind.

T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	969	As for the loopholes, in any bill, there are compromises.
T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	969	With a bill as controversial as this one and enacted right after a very tense and violent campaign, Congressmen are likely to compromise over the bill.
T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	969	Also they add unneeded amendments and money spending called pork barrel.
T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	969	This is done mainly by those who are against the bill in hopes of getting it voted down.

T. Hobbes	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	970	Also you can analyze who put it up for vote, where it is in the voting process, how many nays and ayes there are currently for it, who wrote it and which party they are, when it was introduced, which companies/people are backing the bill, which committee the bill is under, who heads that committee, what that persons political stance on the bill is, how much this bill will cost, who will be paying for it, and approximately how long it will be till it takes effect.Just because President Obama doesn't force Congress to give a daily televised speech on the thousands of bills that pass through it, doesn't mean that it is not becoming more transparent.
The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	971	Barack once promised that every non-emergency bill to come before him would be posted on the WH site for 5 days before he signed it.
The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	971	Took him about one week to break that promise.
The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	971	He's broken it numerous times since.
The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	971	For that matter, has he ever put even one bill on the WH website 5 days before signing it?Kinda funny watching that video NOW.
The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	971	I don't think it's a big deal that he doesn't post bills for public input.
The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	971	He doesn't give a crap what people say anyway.
T. Hobbes	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	972	Kinda funny that people believed he would have time to and that people find it prudent to look on the executive branch's website for a legislative matter.
The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	973	So you knew he was lying?
The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	973	Have you ever looked?
The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	973	He does post bills there.
The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	973	Just not for 5 days.
T. Hobbes	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	974	No, I didn't, but its like getting a great dinner and complaining you didn't get desert.
T. Hobbes	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	974	Good for him!
T. Hobbes	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	974	I'm glad he does, just wondering why people truly expect an executive website to be solely responsible for reports on legislative matters.
Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	From inauguration, BO had total control of both the House and Senate.
Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	The Democrats could pass any bill they wished in a totally partisan manner.
Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	The Republicans could grumble, but were powerless to stop or even delay, any legislation from day one.
Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	Yet it took BO over a year to pass his signature Health Care bill.
Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	And to pass it, a number of DEMOCRATS had to be bribed and coerced and promised who knows what as a group of them SUDDENLY decided to vote for the HCR and RETIRE.
Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	Net result is a bill that only messes up the health care system and will likely forever change health care insurance, and not for the better.That is not good Government.
Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	The PEOPLE said they did NOT want that Health Care bill.
Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	And now The People say they want the bill repealed and a real bi-partisan bill worked out.BO refused to listen, then and now!
Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	The people WILL speak in November and BO will be forced to listen as he becomes essentially a lame duck halfway through his ONLY term.
T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	976	Republicans have just as much right in Congress to fillibuster, pork barrel, amend, and debate the hell out of any bill, which is probably what happened to this bill.
T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	976	As for bribery and all these other ridiculous claims, has anyone had charges brought against them?
T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	976	Anyone been sued?
T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	976	Anyone confronted with evidence?
T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	976	Or are these innocuous claims thrown out into the public for the benefit of our great and benevolent leader?

Batten	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	977	He is too conservative because he let Wall Street walk all over him, when I was expecting him to kick some corporate ass.He is too liberal for me because he sent the Attorney General to Arizona to sue and stop the Arizona immigration law.
Batten	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	977	The border is out of control, and Obama should be trying to work with Governor Jan Brewer to clean up the criminal illegal alien and anchor baby mess.He did get health care passed which was a major issue for me. Will I vote for President Obama again?
Batten	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	977	I answered &quot;yes,&quot; because I believe Obama/Biden will see the light with the help of American labor when it comes to the issue of illegals.

onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	978	They finally started to post some items, but with only a few days til voting.
onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	978	Not enough time.

T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	979	The most that the Executive branch can do is open the court doors to the media, they cannot force them to come and people to watch.
T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	979	In fact much of the time it WAS televised on C-Span but they promised live coverage and votes were being done at unreasonable hours.
T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	979	I believe he promised w/ in 5 days, aka a few days.
T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	979	And you're saying it isn't their right to do so?
T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	979	I'm confused, you seem to believe that the President has enormous legislative power, and yet the judicial branch has none.
T.

T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	979	As of 2010 you're quite right.

T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	979	You are quite right, I did not.
T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	979	I refuse to let somebody let something else debate for them.

T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	979	I was arguing that the President had given up on his attempts, and backed it up by saying it was so high profile it would still be in the news if he were still trying.
T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	979	And you said yes it would be if MSM covered it....?

historicus	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1026	No.
historicus	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1026	And no where in my post did I suggest that.
historicus	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1026	But from your posts we can all easily conclude that you must be another Obama boot licker too dimwitted to understand the mistake you made.At the time Obama appeared to have outmaneuvred Hillary but was not yet the nominee I summed up how dangerous his Presidency might become based on his inexperience, lack of pragmatism, and liberal ideology.It did not take me 1 year into his Presidency to feel vindicated of the predictions I made during his campaign.
historicus	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1026	The mistakes are frequent, and damaging to the Republic.
Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1027	Because it shows that notwithstanding the fact that Obama's lower ratings are constantly posted to show what a crummy job he is doing, ratings at this point in his tenure are likely to bear little resemblance to how he is judged in the future.
historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1028	Really?Is that why most Obama voters actually thought Sara Palin said she could see Russia from her house in Alaska?That is based on a Zogby study post election.
historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1028	The data is on line if you want it.I guess you liberals let Saturday Night Live create reality for you.
Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1029	It wasn't a liberal policy to slash tax revenues and double military spending.I can understanding, looking back at the wreckage that is the Bush administration, why conservatives would now what to distance themselves and claim he was a &quot;liberal.&quot;Sorry.

Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1029	We don't want him.
historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1030	You nailed it.Private Sector expansion is exactly the opposite of the current regimes goals
historicus	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1031	Stop projecting.Bush, like it or not, was one of the most Liberal Republicans ever elected.And never during his Presidency, were either Chambers of Congress, run by Conservatives.You may be able to rewrite history among conversations with your obtuse liberal friends, but not here.
TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1032	Also they don't show a comparison with other candidates.
TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1032	That's the REAL question.

TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	But you haven't done it yet.
TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	Conservatives were in charge of the republican party and therefore they were in charge for 6 out of 8 years of Bush.
TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	Our economy started it's recession in 2007.

TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	So democrats created a recession within a year of them taking over congress?!
TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	Man that takes skill!
TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	Get real.
TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	Republicans/conservatives caused this mess.
TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	And it's the same ones now opposing Obama every move he makes.
TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	I think the fact that we are doing the opposite of what these guys want is a good thing.
Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1034	Label game playing.Bush ran as a conservative, was supported by conservatives, and followed conservative fiscal policies.

TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1035	I don't understand the reasoning.
TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1035	Liberals voted against Bush and his policies not once.
TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1035	Not twice.
TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1035	But 3 times in the past decade.
TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1035	How could Bush possibly be a liberal.
Iriemon	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1036	I think the logic goes ...
Iriemon	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1036	Liberals are to blame for everything, so since the Bush administration was one of the worst in history, he must be a liberal.That's the only way I can figure it.
historicus	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1037	Another dimwitted Obama supporter incapable of critical thought.If Republicans are all Conservatives in your small mind..........Are Democrats all Communists ????thanks in advance
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	She did!!
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	She didn't say &quot;I can see russia from my house&quot; She said something along the lines of this interaction.Interviewer(who I think was Charlie Gibson): What do you say to people that say you don't have enough experience or knowledge of foreign policy issues?&quot;Palin: &quot;Well you know there Charlie, I have been governor of Alaska and you can see Russia from Alaska.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	That gives me foreign policy experience.&quot;That is a horrendously idiotic statement.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	It is just as stupid as saying I can see Russia from my house.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	It conveys the exact same message.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	SNL just added the house part for a bit of comedic effect.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	I can't see the significant difference.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	Maybe you can explain to me why it is ok to say you have foreign policy experience because you can see Russia from a part of your state you have never been to, but it is somehow silly to say the same thing about seeing it from your house.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	It is exactly the same, and if one is stupider, it is the one Palin said.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	At least if she could actually see Russia from her house, it might be some form of strange logic.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	Instead she cannot see Russia, has never seen Russia, and her claims that Russia's proximity to Alaska somehow give her foreign policy experience just seem even stupider.
historicus	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1039	Yup.
historicus	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1039	And his poll numbers partly tanked because Conservatives became more and more angry with his policies.As for Label game playing, you appear to be very good at it.
TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1040	lol huh?

historicus	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1043	Really?Susan Collins calls herself a Conservative?Scott Brown?Olympia Snow?John McKain (when he isnt running for re-election)?Arlen Specter (see McKain) ???I can go on, but I can see you are not really interested in reality
historicus	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1044	Yup.Look in a mirror.Most Obama boot lickers are, so you at least have company.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1045	Yes you are half way there.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1045	Reagan's policies led to rapid private sector expansion, followed by rapid private sector collapse.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1045	So we can either follow Reagan's model and get those years like 84-85 and have 5% growth, which will then be followed by 10% loss.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1045	Or we can follow the post WWII Keynsian model that saw the longest period of uninterrupted global expansion in human history.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1045	Maybe we never saw one or 2 years of massive growth, but we never saw rapid declines either.

frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1045	There can of course be over regulation, and if that occurs some deregulation makes sense.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1045	But the constant deregulation left the markets to their whims, and we saw the outcomes that followed.

frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	I suppose there a few issues you could say he was liberal about, immigration for example.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	But you could also spin that and say he supported the free market, and supported the free movement of labor, so he didn't want to intervene with the market.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	Which is what strict labor immigration control is. What else was Bush Liberal about?
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	He spent a lot!!
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	But that is a conservative trait in the modern world not a liberal one.

historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1055	So, we've some to the point where supporting the Free Market now equals being a Conservativethe Party of JFK died a long time ago.How about the work he did with the drunk Ted Kennedy on education &quot;reform&quot; ??The expansion of government creating the Department of Homeland security ???He spent like a drunken sailor - which is not conservative.
historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1056	Of course that was not the question asked.Did she say she could see it from her House?Obama supporters say............Of course she did.Its only boring you because you cant handle the facts.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1057	Yes it is. That is what modern conservatives do.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1057	Reagan spent more like a drunken sailor than Bush, and he actually increased the debt more than Bush comparable to the time periods(in other words Bush increased the debt more by a total number, but Reagan a greater percentage).That education reform was not something any liberal would ever support, that is for sure.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1057	Nor is the oppressive actions taken to fight the war on terror.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1057	That is something moderates like Obama do, and conservatives like Bush do.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1057	Not actual liberals.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1057	Never.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	Then you are pointing out irrelevancies.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	People were confused about the exact wordings of a Palin statement, and that is a sign of what?
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	You remember every word that Palin ever said as an exact quote?
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	Of course not.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	You remember the basic premise of the things she said.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	The basic premise of what she said was incredibly similar to &quot;I can see russia from my house&quot; PS.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	I am liberal and I know exactly what she said.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	So really, your point is without merit.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	The fact that people got confused about the wording of an answer sarah palin gave is irrelevant to anything I was actually talking about.
historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1059	educate yourself will yai even included a Washington Post link first, written in 2007.
historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1059	that Bush was a Liberal Republican is not new news, however, considering how you must need him to be a conservative, so your own ideology doesnt get too close to being something of the Soviet Union, or Venezuela's - we can all understand how desperate you need the Bush / conservative myth to be believed.Not that 3 crummy links will change your mind, but heck Cohen and the Wash Post wrote about it years agoBush the Neoliberalhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn...052801053.htmlHow the Policies of the Bush Administration Are Liberal in Theoryhttp://www.associatedcontent.com/art...a_liberal.htmlPresident Bush’s Liberal Viewshttp://www.newdonkey.com/president-b...ral-views.html
historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1060	I will accept this as an admission that Obama supporters are more likely to be guided by Saturday Night Live skit than reality.Or that Obama supporters were/are gullible village idiots who actually believed Obama was going to lower taxes, that they could keep their health care, and so on and so onthe hard part for you is, the game is over and Independents (and hopefully some actual real Democrats) finally wised up
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Ah you mean the whole spreading democracy throughout the world.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Well that was old school American liberalism for sure.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	The thing is though, that has been the policy of both Republican and Democratic presidents since the start of the cold war.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Pre-WWII I would agree the conservative position tended to be isolationist and the liberal tended to have more expansive and optimistic foreign policy goals.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	That hasn't been true very often since that point.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	And it absolutely hasn't been true at least since the 70sI think your problem is, you seem to be confusing libertarianism with conservatism.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Even that last link you gave said Bush was conservative, he just believed in some liberal policies.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	The truth is he is a Reagan style conservative.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Insane spending.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Belief in using foreign policy to promote and spread democracy.

frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Tax cuts.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	That is Reagan's playbook copied by GW Bush.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Yet you seem to like Reagan and call Bush a liberal.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	When they have so many similarities that doesn't make much sense.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1063	The hard part for you is I strongly oppose Obama's presidency.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1063	I haven't defended Obama once, and if you look at my vote I said I wouldn't vote for Obama.
frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1063	So that is clearly not the explanation.
historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1064	I think your problem is projecting.I am a registered libertarian who voted for Michael Badnerik in 2004, and wrote in Ron Paul in 2008 - and more often than not, voted Libertarians when given a choice.Although I will admit, I have never voted for the communist with the D by their name.

historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1065	Then I apologize for projecting a bit myself
Dan40	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1066	The FACT that Bush was not Conservative, does NOT mean he was a liberal.
Dan40	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1066	He spent like one but didn't tax like one.
Dan40	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1066	Bush was a fiscally bad President.
Dan40	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1066	And probably best called a moderate Republican.
Dan40	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1066	True Conservatives and moderate to conservative Independents agree that Bush left much to be desired, especially in the spending area.What befuddles me [among other things] is how liberals blame Bush for ALL including the excess spending, YET say obummer is doing GOOD by spending 3 times as much?????????I guess the liberal, dreamland, &quot;perfect world,&quot; mind has no need for logic.
historicus	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1067	AgreedI missed where he credited Clinton with balancing the budget and completely ignored the Republican takeover in 94 and the Contract with Americawho believes, had that not happened, Clinton would have balanced the budget with a Democratic controlled House ?
Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1068	It was 1995 the Republicans took over.It is speculation as to what would have happened.
Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1068	But the Dems passed the 1993 tax increase that flooded the Treasury with revenues which gave us the surplus budget, and the deficit was falling rapidly in those two years before the Republicans got control.
Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1068	Furthermore, we saw once Bush got into office that the Republican congress wasn't exactly thrifty when it comes to spending.Year - &quot;on-budget&quot; deficit/surplus1992 -340.41993 -300.4 &lt;- Clinton takes office1994 -258.81995 -226.4 &lt;- Republicans take control of Congress1996 -174.01997 -103.21998 -29.91999 1.9Source: CBO.govThe deficits had already fallen 33&#37; in the years before the Republicans took congress.
historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1069	And this is borderline delusional&quot;Right wing liars&quot; distort the facts and change history when attempting to correct what Saturday Night Live said versus Sara Palin?Its actually quite entertaining.
historicus	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1070	Yes, but it is commonly referred to as the 1994 takeover which is when the election was.Remember it, because we will be referring to Americans taking back the House this time around as the 2010 takeover
Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1071	Not in my experience.
Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1071	You're not the first who incorrectly stated the Republicans took over in 1994.
Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1071	And the Republicans will retain congress in 2002 and McCain will win the election in 2004.
Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1071	Folks predict all kinds of things.
historicus	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1072	Like Obama being a pragmatic centrist
Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1074	Fair enough, people can say that to refer to the election.I think we've got the record straight they didn't take actual control of Congress until 1995, after the deficit had been declining rapidly for two years.
TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1075	The election was in 1994 but they didn't get into office until 1995.
TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1075	Just like Bush had control of the white house when the 2009 deficit was predicted to be a staggering 1.2 trillion dollars even before we knew the full extent of the financial crash.
Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1077	What question and who are you addressing?
TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1078	me. He's asking me if calling republicans conservative is the same as calling democrats communists.

frodly	Bassman	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1094	Mertex said they don't deserve power, what the hell relevance does that have to Bolshevism?
frodly	Bassman	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1094	Did Mertex say the party should sieze control and stop Republicans from taking control?
frodly	Bassman	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1094	Certainly not.
frodly	Bassman	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1094	But anyone who was even semi-conscious between 2001 and 2009 must understand how disastrous Republican control is. Maybe one day people, when they realize Democrats suck, will not then turn to Republicans only to realize they also suck, just to turn back to Democrats.
frodly	Bassman	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1094	Maybe one day people will wake up and break that cycle.
frodly	Bassman	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1094	There is no doubt that Republicans do not deserve power with their record though.

historicus	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1096	You appear to be guilty of that yourself.Suggesting Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins, Arlen Specter and John McKain are self appointed conservatives is certainly using words you simply do not understand.

TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1098	There are multiple subfactions of conservatism.

TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1098	But the neo cons of the republican party are no less conservative than the libertarians.I am not wrong.
TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1098	I just don't have a political agenda to redefine conservativism to separate it from the neo cons and George W. Bush.

TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1100	No because the basic defintion of communism is a desire for the state to take complete control of all businesses.Not a single democrat has proposed any such thing.
TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1100	You are truly doing a poor job displaying your knowledge of political ideologies and their definitions.

Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1136	Now, if a liberal (or anyone else) calls someone a &quot;racist&quot; based not on the person's race, but on their own inability to conduct and intelligent argument, then the liberal is not discriminating or being prejudiced against that person based on race, but based on ignorance, right?
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1136	So by definition, that does not indicate they are racist at all, does it?Now, what were you saying about being able to conduct an intelligent argument?
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1136	In the meantime, the rest of us will just savor the delicious irony of you calling liberals the most racist for calling others racists when being unable to conduct an intelligent argument.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1137	As a liberal, you naturally want to define racist in the narrowest terms possible.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1137	However, in reality, [a term foreign to liberals] playing the race card against all and any at every opportunity is RACIST, whether you wish to acknowledge that or not.IE calling the AZ law RACIST when it is not, IS RACIST.

farrar	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1138	Racists believe that all individual who share superficial physical characteristics are alike; as collectivists, racists think only in terms of groups.
farrar	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1138	By encouraging Americans to adopt a group mentality, the advocates of so-called &quot;diversity&quot; actually perpetuate racism.
farrar	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1138	Their intense focus on race is inherently racist, because it views individuals only as members of racial groups.Conservatives and libertarians should fight back and challenge the myth that collectivist liberals care more about racism.
farrar	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1138	Modern liberalism, however well intentioned, is a byproduct of the same collectivist thinking that characterizes racism.

Iriemon	farrar	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1140	How the hell are conservatives going to fight about it when they don't even know what &quot;racist&quot; means.Here we have Dan40 whose thinks the word &quot;racist&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with anything about race, prejudice, or discrimination.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1141	So since you are calling liberals racists thereby playing the race card, exactly what you accuse liberals of doing, does not that make you a racist too by your own definition?

farrar	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1142	That may just be my opinion.Also I will say in regard to Dan40, that calling a law racist, doesn't make someone racist, it makes them ignorant of what racist means.

Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1143	The race card is a liberal weapon to be used against any that disagree with their silly Utopian dreams.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1143	And using it against all who disagree is a slur against all people of color, so YES, calling people racist when they are not, is an insult, and therefore RACIST.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1144	Oh so now any insult is racist?lol

farrar	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1148	Here is an elementary example:before--there were 7 yellow people and 3 green ppl unemployed equaling 10&#37; of the populationnow--there are 10 yellow people and 10 green ppl equaling 20% of the populationBefore for instance, they counted yellow and greens in unemployment.
farrar	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1148	So in this mock example 10% of people are unemployed.
farrar	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1148	Now they stoped counting green people.
farrar	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1148	so it looks like only 10% unemployment.
farrar	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1148	Therefore as far as we know, there has been little change.In real terms the government says we have 10% unemployment and 2% inflation.
farrar	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1148	In terms we used from the very beginning (before) or unmanipulated... we actually have 22% unemployment and 6% inflation...
farrar	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1148	So yes, the Bureau of labor satistics is kind of bull.
Dan40	farrar	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1149	Sorry, but it is always the liberals that use the word racist as a weapon against any that disagree with them.
Dan40	farrar	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1149	Other words could apply equally to all groups, but liberals have cornered the market on using the word, racist, as a put down for all dissent.

Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1177	According to the BLS they are NO LONGER UNEMPLOYED.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1177	The unemployment rate dropped from 9.7 to 9.5 a couple of months ago, NOT because people had found work, but because the BLS SAID 652,000, formerly unemployed, PEOPLE HAD, &quot;LEFT THE LABOR FORCE!&quot;You choose to believe the Democrat/liberal Pols and disbelieve the Republican/conservative Pols.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1177	The operative word is they are Pols., they both LIE!!!!We NEED part-time, non-career legislators, not power mad politicians.Do we need ranting idiots like Grayson using his franking privilege to spend $75,000,000.00 to mail out re-election CD's on our Dollar.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1177	Not on his campaign money, our tax money.
The12thMan	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1178	What we need is to get the lawyers out of govt altogether.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1179	GAH!
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1179	No! People who lose unemployment benefits are STILL counted as unemployed so long as they are still looking for work.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1179	How many times do I have to say it?
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1179	You quoted the link that proves yourself wrong.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1179	Seriously...it takes the motion of one index finger and a little reading time to learn and you still refuse to do so!I posted the link.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1179	I was told it was a BS source.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1179	I reiterated the link cannot be a BS source because the source is straight from the horse's mouth.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1179	The BLS is responsible for counting unemployment.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1179	I was still told I was wrong.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1179	So I posted the link again and copyed and pasted the exact section that proves me right.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1179	Since you STILL cannot read after going to the EXACT section it proves me right I will now copy and past the EXACT PARAGRAPH that proves me right.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1179	If you can't even read a paragraph then you really don't belong on this forum.http://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm#where
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1180	You just posted a link about Obama's birth certificate that I proved was BS... double standards?

Capitalist Pig	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1181	I wish I had a 25% gain in that!
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1182	Then what is motivating you to be racist?
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1182	Oh, that's right, you aren't, you just sound racist.
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1182	Conservative?
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1182	Some conservatives are racist, even though they don't claim to be Republican.
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1182	Like Ron Paul, he claims to be Independent, but runs on the Republican ticket?
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1182	It would be nice to replace incumbents from both parties with impartial, unbiased, non-racist incumbents, but soon you find that even the ones calling themselves Independents have their own special warts.And extremes on both sides are insane and out of touch with reality, but recently the Republican party has grown a whole slew of them, they call themselves &quot;Tea Party&quot;!
mertex	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1183	Birthers will never accept Obama's birth certificate, no matter how official and authentic it is. That's your problem not Obama's.
mertex	Capitalist Pig	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1184	Seems to me Reps flip-flop on what they want.
mertex	Capitalist Pig	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1184	Not to long ago Palin and McCain were both for cap and trade, now they are against it!
mertex	Capitalist Pig	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1184	Is that the same with you?
mertex	Capitalist Pig	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1184	If McCain had won, you'd be all for it, right?Sarah Palin's Flip-Flop on Cap-and-TradePOSTED BY CLOE ON JULY 20, 2009 AT 08:01 PMSince Sarah Palin announced that she’d be resigning her post as Alaska’s governor (16 month early) a couple of weeks ago, she’s made it clear that she plans to spend more time traveling around the lower 48 states.
mertex	Capitalist Pig	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1184	True to task, on Tuesday Palin had an oped in the Washington Post articulating her opposition to President Obama’s energy plan which includes a cap-and-trade program that would allow industrial sources to buy and sell pollution permits.But it looks like she’s a little unclear on what her policy positions are.
mertex	Capitalist Pig	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1184	During the campaign, McCain-Palin campaign literature (check it out below) and the candidate herself (see the video) sang a totally different tune.THEN: “They [McCain-Palin] have proposed a cap-and-trade system that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions while encouraging the development of low-cost compliance options.
mertex	Capitalist Pig	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1184	A climate cap-and-trade mechanism would set a limit on greenhouse gas emissions and allow entities to buy and sell rights to emit, similar to the successful acid rain trading program of the early 1990s.
mertex	Capitalist Pig	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1184	The key feature of this mechanism is that it allows the market to decide and encourage the lowest-cost compliance options.”NOW: Palin wants to “…responsibly tap the resources that God created right underfoot on American soil” and drill in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.http://www.democrats.org/a/2009/07/sarah_palins_fl.php
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1185	Double standards?
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1185	Every birther arguement has been proven beyond a doubt to be false.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1185	No court in this country has even accepted a birther case because they are so mind numbingly void of evidence.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1186	What you liberals interpret as &quot;extremes&quot; are everyone that does not share your beautiful and fine sounding but impossible Utopian dreams.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1186	&quot;Everything for Everybody,&quot; would be the end result for all liberals.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1186	Well certainly it would be wonderful if everyone was free from want and need and WORK.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1186	But that is not only impossible, it is impossible in the &quot;extreme.&quot;And the Tea Party IS the American Silent Majority finding its voice.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1186	Libs.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1186	can't understand that and reject that simple TRUTH.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1186	IS the 'tea party' a mixed bag?
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1186	Certainly it is, its AMERICA.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1186	Standing up for actual VALUES instead of 'dreaming impossible dreams.&quot;Should libs FEAR the Silent Majority?
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1186	Oh very YES.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1186	Not for violence, but because it means the end of liberalism and progressiveness.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1186	And will re-establish the idea of rewards for hard work and accomplishment instead of rewarding mediocrity and abject whining.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1186	Out of touch with reality?Missouri voted 71&#37; against obummercare.Gibbs said, to paraphrase, &quot;doan mean nuttin.&quot; That was what was said in Vietnam to avoid reality.Reid said.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1186	The more people learn about the health care bill, the better they like it.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1186	That is BOTH untrue and out of touch with reality.So Gibbs and Reid are both out of touch with reality or both intentional liars.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1186	And most likely BOTH are Both.And Gallup, not FOX, not Rasmussen, now has obummer's approval at 41% for vs 57% AGAINST.

Dan40	RealGroupSpeak	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1194	And a number of useless and unwanted and unworkable laws have been rammed through using parliamentary tricks, bribes, and coercion and 100% partisan politics.The whole world now thinks the USA is a silly joke instead of an international leader.
Dan40	RealGroupSpeak	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1194	Instead of listening to us, now the world ignores us OR tells us what to do and how to act.Plenty of change, just NONE good.
Dan40	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1195	I've already asked if there is a difference between the idea of &quot;Redistribute the Wealth.&quot; The mantra of B.O. And the tenet of, &quot;From each according to his ability, To each according to his need.&quot; The BASIC plank in the Communist Platform.Those two statements are identical in meaning.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1196	I don't have any issue with the communist motto &quot;From each according to their ability to each according to their need&quot; That sounds like a good way to form tax policy.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1196	Give the most to the neediest.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1196	Nothing wrong with that.But if you believe that to be representative of Communist platform you are sorely mistaken.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1196	Nothing about Obama and the democrat's platform even remotely resembles communism.

TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1199	Especially in a bad recession?
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1199	Because every economist agrees that the best way to get out of a recession fast (especially in this one where consumer demand is low) is to shift wealth to the poor as fast as possible to get money flowing again.The only people who are foolish are those who believe otherwise.

TheTaoOfBill	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1201	I would think the proof would be in the fact that largest economic crash since the great depression (and probably even larger than that) was quickly ended less than a year after the stimulus bill.
Gremlin-USA	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1202	Giving unearned money to the poor and to people hurt by the recession are two different things.People who are down on their luck, out of a job, due to no fault of their own deserve help.People who are lazy and do not try to look for work are a whole different story.Just saying give the money to the poor will stimulate the economy is incorrect.
Gremlin-USA	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1202	How many of the lazy will spend that money on drugs?Want to spend some money on the lazy?
Gremlin-USA	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1202	Take this old proverb into reality, instead of giving a man food a fish to eat each day, teach him to fish and he can provide for himself for ever.

Gremlin-USA	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1202	If BO just gave all 110 million taxpayers an equal cut of the Trillions he has spent in the last 19 months, how much would everyone have to invest into the economy, that makes a lot more sense than than re-distributing the wealth to non-supporters of of our CountryBack to the OP, I would not vote for BO in a million years......

TheTaoOfBill	Gremlin-USA	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1204	We're giving them enough to support a family at bare minimum needs.
TheTaoOfBill	Gremlin-USA	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1204	And in some cases we're giving them a job.
TheTaoOfBill	Gremlin-USA	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1204	As I said before.
TheTaoOfBill	Gremlin-USA	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1204	Most people who get on welfare want nothing more than to get off.
TheTaoOfBill	Gremlin-USA	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1204	It's a below the poverty line life style and it's no way to raise a family or even live on your own.
TheTaoOfBill	Gremlin-USA	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1204	No that wouldn't make more sense because there are people that do not need the extra money and would just put it in their rainy day fund.
TheTaoOfBill	Gremlin-USA	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1204	The big corporate leaders aren't going to use that money to hire more people since demand is so low it doesn't warrant hiring more people.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	My post was in re: your wholehearted endorsement of Communism.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	Evidently Liberalism is now Communism for those that cannot spell Communism.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	The philosophies are the same.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	TAKE from those who have, Give to those who have not earned.As far as your post above and its attempt to change the subject.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	Those that can see the extremely obvious FACT that B.O.'s policies have NOT recovered the economy even enough for REAL job creation to keep up with population growth.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	Are not foolish.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	Unemployment claims are up again.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	There was a little drop for a few weeks but now its on the rise again.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	AND the BLS once again said that the rate maintained at 9.5% because ANOTHER 187,000 formerly unemployed, exhausted their benefits and DROPPED OUT of the labor market.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	Not my words, or RNC's words or Rush's words, this comes straight from the BLS.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	Is the economy better?
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	Yes it is very MARGINALLY better.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	obummer and the Stimulus?
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	No, could be any reason for the minuscule improvement.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	And trying to claim that his &quot;enlightened&quot; policies resulted in an all but invisible improvement IS FOOLISH.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	Wonder if Roemer, his main economic adviser QUIT or was FIRED this week.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	A really intelligent person in charge would NOT be trying to take credit for such little results of MASSIVE spending.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	Give obummer credit for all the jobs he CLAIMS to have &quot;Created&quot; and it works out to over Half a MILLION Dollars per job.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	At that rate, a ROBUST economy will cost us Quadrillions, not Trillions.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	Great economy, impoverished country.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	Not a gain.More and more, day by day, the population of the USA is realizing that obum is completely mired in purely ideological agendas that have nothing to do with the responsibility of Governing.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	He is an incompetent dreamer or worse.
Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1206	I think there's a difference, mainly in scale.
Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1206	Even Adam Smith advocated &quot;redistributing wealth&quot; in the form of a progressive tax structure.
Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1206	Our federal tax bracket is the lowest it's been in decades.
Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1206	The main idea behind Communism, in theory, was to provide total economic equality because of the huge amount of inequality that Marx witnessed.
Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1206	The only way to do that in an existing system of government is to not tax the lower classes and tax the upper class 100%, caps on income, etc. I don't see anything like that coming from the Obama administration.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	Your inability to see the obvious is not the subject.Economic Equality is an oxymoron.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	Some have the ability to become wealthy, some do not.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	We have equality of opportunity.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	All have the opportunity to make the attempt at wealth.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	Wealth CANNOT be given to those that have not and can not earn it.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	Money can be given to them and Trillions have been.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	They waste it one way or another.The more you take from the wealthy, the more you damage everyone, including the poor.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	NO wealthy person has their stack of money locked in a vault.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	The money is always in action in the economy.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	Invigorating the economy and creating jobs, NOT sitting and shrinking from inflation.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	That IS the only way it can grow.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	And that benefits the poor MORE than giving them dollars to be wasted.BHO has the incredible blessing of historical timing.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	He has done NOTHING of note with his life before or after being elected to political office, including the present position.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	He was a do nothing state rep. A do nothing Federal Senator, and now a do nothing [good] president.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	But he came from nowhere in 2008 in a political vacuum.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	And now timing blesses him again with unusually low inflation.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	Notice that no lib.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	is blaming Bush for that.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	Inflation is very low, artificially low.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	If we were running even normal inflation rates, calls for impeachment would already have been heard.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	BO's failed economic policy does not show up as bad as they are, due to very low inflation.BHO has had more political luck and blessing than any politician in the last 100 years.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	He has no skills for governing, just luck.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	He has wasted every bit of it.
Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1208	And how does any of this relate to your claim that &quot;redistribution of wealth&quot; and &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need&quot; is the same?
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1209	I don't recall endorsing communism.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1210	Liberals don't recognize history.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1210	Everybody knows that.
Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1211	Again, how is this relevant to anything?
Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1211	Throwing out random bits of nonsense won't get you anywhere.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1212	Random bits of nonsense?
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1212	I cannot argue with an expert in that field.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1212	And all liberals are experts at random bits of nonsense.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1212	But the pendulum is swinging away from the utter nonsense of liberalism and back to the logic of conservatism.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1212	It will take a few more years but your day in the sun is ending.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1212	Once again actual accomplishments will be rewarded and there will be no more rewards for being a parasite on society.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1212	If one's accomplishments are meager, so then will their rewards be equally meager.
Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1213	Using fallacious arguments over and over and over again wouldn't exactly ensure that you are above using nonsense, and arrogantly trying to portray that I do as such, even though, out of the two of us, I'm the only one even attempting to further discuss the topic at hand.
Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1213	I'm terribly sorry that you can't manage to support your own position, but it's no reason to be unnecessarily antagonistic.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1214	The reality of the country around us supports my position perfectly and completely negates yours.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1214	I have no need to prove the obvious while you have no possibility of disproving the ridiculousness of liberalism.It is what it is. Liberals have had their run most all of the 20th Century.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1214	It didn't work.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1214	Your time is gone.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1214	The transition will take a bit but it is time for liberals to fade into the background.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1214	Sadly at some time in the future, the pendulum will swing back your way.
Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1214	I'll be gone.
mertex	dixiehunter	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1215	Bwahahaha!
mertex	dixiehunter	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1215	You've been watching Faux News too long.
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1216	Conservatives keep rewriting history, everybody knows that.
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1217	Sigh, shifting the wealth... again, how is that correct, responsible, and ethical?
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1217	Oh wait it's not.
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1217	You are TAKING from one to give something to another that did nothing.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1218	Yeah like Clinton's mythical Budget surplus that every Democrat never fails to mention.What they do not mention is that Clinton COOPERATED with a Republican Congress to come close to balancing the budget.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1218	And that in no fiscal year of Clinton's Presidency did the national debt come down.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1218	It went up every year!
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1218	Altho in small amounts that we would love to have today.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1218	But spending was NEVER so controlled that the interest on the debt did not cause the debt to increase.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1218	Interest IS part of the problem and must be counted same as reckless spending.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1218	But again kudos to Clinton and the Republicans for as well as they did.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1218	We could use that cooperation today.Just one small example of true history that Dems and libs seem to get wrong constantly.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1219	You're being charged to live in one of the greatest countries in America.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1219	It's the only way to pay for such freedom that's fair.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1220	And how much are the Takers being charged and by whom.HALF of our &quot;greatest country&quot; GETS while the other half GIVES.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1220	And you profess that is Right???
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1221	Part of living in this great country means if the proper channels are filed no one should ever starve in this country.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1221	You might be giving right now.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1221	But if God forbid you fall into a situation where you can't afford food any longer you will be thankful to be in a country where you can get tax assistance as well.I'm sorry you'd rather live in a country where we allow people to starve because of their financial situation.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1221	But thankfully we are a land of freedom.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1221	Not greed.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1222	As always the liberal Utopian dreams sound beautiful, but they DO NOT stand up to reality.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1222	HALF this country ARE parasites living QUITE WELL off the half that are responsible hard working citizens.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1222	And of the half that are parasites, LESS THAN 10&#37; approach anything that could be called REAL poverty.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1222	And only a tiny percentage EVER go to bed HUNGRY.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1222	Most are over nourished on junk food and grossly FAT!
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1222	Starving is nearly NON-EXISTENT in this country.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1222	Freeloading is a life career for half the country.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1222	THAT, is the reason I object.
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1223	Really?
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1223	So you being on food stamps or a bridge card (I forget which one you are on), while I work 2 jobs to pay for my college, etc... is ok, while you don't have a job.

TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1224	It's fair because A. I'm probably in a lot more debt.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1224	And B. You can probably afford more things.

TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1224	And if you did it would be for a lot less money.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1224	And D. Even someone working 2 jobs could get a bridge card if they wanted to and they make less than the required money.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1224	I suggest you stop whining and apply.

Antix	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1225	He said he was against The Patriot act but voted for it.2) In his healthcare bill, he used backdoor meetings to secure votes by unions etc..
Antix	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1225	The bill itself was changed multiple times before republicans could properly read it, and democrats as well.3) Is going to let Bush tax cuts expire, which is going to increase taxes.
Antix	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1225	His administration has announced tax increases due to the healthcare bill, and thats for everyone.

Saxon Caucasus	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1252	Production as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employment, investment spending, capacity utilization, household incomes, business profits and inflation all fall during recessions; while bankruptcies and the unemployment rate rise.Recessions are generally believed to be caused by a widespread drop in spending.
Saxon Caucasus	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1252	Governments usually respond to recessions by adopting expansionary macroeconomic policies, such as increasing money supply, increasing government spending and decreasing taxation.and it could be truthfully argued that we're in a depression: wikipediaDepressionIn economics, a depression is a sustained, long-term downturn in economic activity in one or more economies.
Saxon Caucasus	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1252	It is a more severe downturn than a recession, which is seen by economists as part of a normal business cycle.Considered a rare and extreme form of recession, a depression is characterized by its length, and by abnormally large increases in unemployment, falls in the availability of credit— quite often due to some kind of banking/financial crisis, shrinking output and investment, numerous bankruptcies— including sovereign debt defaults, significantly reduced amounts of trade and commerce— especially international, as well as highly volatile relative currency value fluctuations— most often due to devaluations.
Saxon Caucasus	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1252	Price deflation, financial crises and bank failures are also common elements of a depression.Of course the government will tell you that everything is great and we're doing just fine and indicators show that we're pulling out of it and all of our measures have worked and...blah blah...etc...lies...etc..

We all just make up our minds before hand and never change any of our opinions... we also do not know how to not have an opinion and we know who we will vote for 2 years in advance.

mertex	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1290	The more reforms the Democrats enact, the less happy independent voters – who, presumably, voted for Democrats because they wanted many of these reforms enacted – are.If this discontent produces the sort of &quot;enthusiasm gap&quot; at the elections hinted at in many recent polls, November could indeed see significant gains for the GOP.That said, my guess is the gains won't be quite as large as many pundits think, that the much-anticipated rout won't actually occur.
mertex	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1290	There are signs, in recent polls, that as the election nears and more people start paying attention to the debates, voters are starting to return to the Democrats.
mertex	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1290	They might detest incumbents, and, for a variety of reasons, they may feel increasingly disillusioned with the Obama administration, but when push comes to shove most voters also aren't convinced by the GOP message.Predictions are always a dangerous game in politics, but at this point my guess is that the Democrats will cling on to power, with significantly reduced majorities, in both houses of Congress.http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisf...s-achievements

Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1349	It is only the latter that is referred to as the &quot;General Welfare Clause&quot; of this document.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1349	However, it has been argued that, in the case of the United States Constitution, the statement regarding the &quot;general welfare&quot; was not then and is not now intended to give plenary power to the federal government.[2] These clauses in the U.S. Constitution are exceptions to the typical use of a general welfare clause, and are not considered grants of a general legislative power to the federal government as the U.S. Supreme Court has held: * the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution &quot;has never been regarded as the source of any substantive power conferred on the Government of the United States or on any of its Departments&quot;;[3][4] and, * that Associate Justice Joseph Story's construction of the Article I, Section 8 General Welfare Clause—as elaborated in Story's 1833 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States—was the correct interpretation.[5][6] Justice Story concluded that the General Welfare Clause was not an independent grant of power, but a qualification on the taxing power which included within it a power to spend tax revenues on matters of general interest to the federal government.Thomas Jefferson explained the latter general welfare clause for the United States: “[T]he laying of taxes is the power, and the general welfare the purpose for which the power is to be exercised.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1349	They [Congress] are not to lay taxes ad libitum for any purpose they please; but only to pay the debts or provide for the welfare of the Union.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1349	In like manner, they are not to do anything they please to provide for the general welfare, but only to lay taxes for that purpose.”[7]In 1824 Chief Justice John Marshall described in obiter dictum a further limit on the General Welfare Clause in Gibbons v. Ogden: &quot;Congress is authorized to lay and collect taxes, &amp;c. to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1349	Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States.&quot;[8]

mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1399	Because she says the same garbage you do?
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1399	Bwahahaha!If it walks like a duck, looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it is a duck!
mertex	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1400	Gee, if that is true, then why were you willing that we sacrifice over 4000+ of our soldiers to give &quot;Muslims&quot; a democracy?
mertex	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1400	How do we know that some of those 84,000,000 are not in Iraq?How do Reps get to designate which ones are bad?
mertex	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1401	You have a handful of Dems that got sucked into that &quot;sensitivity bs&quot; and Harry Reid, who is vying for votes from that whacko Angle, so he has to appeal to the righties.
mertex	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1401	When you associate American Muslims with the 9/11 incident you are in a sense holding them responsible for it.
mertex	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1401	They had victims there too.
mertex	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1401	It is still not a mosque.
mertex	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1401	Most politicians aren't trying to change all the amendments like the reps are.
mertex	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1401	The Tea Party is a farce.
mertex	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1401	Most of the supporters of the Tea Party would bring W back in a minute, no matter what he did to our country.
RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Disclaimer.
RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	This is a long post and I may have made a typo or three.
RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	If you see something that angers you such as me not adding the &#8216;radical&#8217; prefix before &#8216;Muslim&#8217; please ask me if that is what I meant!
RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	I have no problems with the Islam or Muslims or any other religion including those that have a lack of religion.
RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	I do have a problem with all haters who hate for unspecified reasons or simply don&#8217;t like Christianity or religion and have the need to bash Christians at every turn.
RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	And as a preacher church owner, and non profit Christian humanitarian mission owner I do not tolerate or will not be around my Christian brothers and sisters that hate for the same reasons as above.
RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Whew ~ Hi Mertex!
RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	If the supporters and those doing the funding (no one knows who is funding the Mosque as of Aug 1 2010) etc would build somewhere else I would be willing to bet that a conservative group would donate land to build it on as a reciprocal gesture of good faith.
RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	It's just a guess but I know my conservatives.
RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	(I lean towards the conservative side mostly because of my religion).
RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Nevertheless, If they go ahead with plans to build the mosque it will be a very dangerous place to be and it will breed seething, venomous anger all the way round'.
RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	The Mosque supporters certainly have the right to build it, but what a gesture it would be if they decided to move it!
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	As a devout Christian I too think that is wrong.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Maybe he meant radical Muslims?
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Moderate Islam is a beautiful religion that fairly mirrors Christianity right up to where Abraham almost sacrifices his son.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	My surgeon of five years is a devout Muslim, and she is beautiful I must say!
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Trust me if I lumped all Muslims together I would find another MD!
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Yes, but that is the point, There are too many coincidences for there not to be something malicious going on.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	I was somewhat against the mosque before I found out that it would be dedicated on the anniversary of 9/11!
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	That was what turned me against it, Then I researched where the funding originated and the Cordoba group etc. More bad feelings!
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	I feel the true intent is not good.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	I also feel that the good Muslims that support the Mosque as well as secular liberals etc have been fooled by this malicious element into believing that the intent and the purpose of the projected mosque is benign and meant to foster good will etc. .
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Can you clarify and expand on that?
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	What is wrong with the right-wing, GOP, Tea Party ideology?
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Personally being an Anarchist (I would like to rearrange the USA completely) but a registered independent I feel that the right-wing, GOP, Tea Party will save our country from sure total destruction by well meaning liberals.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	They are led by a malicious element who thinks we can spend our way out of this recession.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Yes the malicious element is none other than Obama!
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	He insists on socializing our country, which is another sure way to break the bank.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	He seems hell bent to do every thing to ruin this shaky recovery (and a jobless one at that).
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	And I think he has plans for making the USA fully socialist.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Then there is the fact that this administration thinks we can appease the Taliban types or the Ben Laden style terrorists who are the freedom fighters of major Islamic world powers.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	These states want to destroy Israel and the USA ASAP.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	The terrorist sponsoring nations and oil rich citizens fund &amp; give aid and support to all anti christian anti secular western terrorists and the Islamic militants.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Their stated primary goal is to convert or kill all of us including our children and everyone that does not convert to Islam.Its time to give the militarized radical Islamic terrorists an offer they should not and ultimately can not refuse.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	It should he fair offer.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	However, we should then take a zero tolerance policy with regards to terror and began isolating the entire western hemisphere militarily industrially economically scientifically with emphasis on pure R&amp;D.ra
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	Your misconceptions, misunderstandings, and outright FEAR of the tea party make your posts about them laughable.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	NO ONE at any tea party I've attended would ever think of bringing Bush back even if it was possible.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	The near instantaneous growth of the tea party after the elections was because we all thought we could put the calamity of the Bush years behind us and get on with repairing the nation.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	Instead we were presented with an even more incompetent idiot clown without ANY clue of what the Presidency means or how to even begin doing the job.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	And now approaching 2 years later, he shows on a daily basis that he is in fact a clown that history will find hilarious, but not for many, many years.The good news is that he has started another vacation.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	This time on Martha's Vineyard for 10 days.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	Did they get unpacked from the last one?
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	But when he's on vacation, he's doing less damage to the nation.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	Failure on a daily basis must be so extremely exhausting that he needs constant vacations.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	When the liberals lose control of Congress in Nov. he will need overlapping vacations from then on.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	Are you claiming that the Muslims that are trying to convert that Wal-mart building into a community center are radical Muslims?
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	Otherwise, it doesn't make any sense - why you would associate them with the Al Qaeda that is responsible for 9/11.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	It would be understandable if they were, that they would not be a welcome sight anywhere near Ground Zero.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	I have no doubt that there would be some Christian (wealthy person) that would be more than generous and would donate the land, but most of the ones complaining are more interested in just denying these people their Constitutional right and have created this &quot;sensitivity&quot; bs, since the building is not even that close to Ground Zero.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	I realize that, but conservatives do less that resembles what Christ would want them to do when it comes to politics, that I wonder why so many believe they are doing what Christ would want them to do.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	I wonder if Christians were the ones building a church and the Muslims were complaining, if the Christians would be as willing to move or would they do what so many of them do, and become violent and hateful.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	Like when they are told to remove a statue of the 10 Commandments out of a government building - and they go against all the laws?
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	If these Muslims are willing to build somewhere else, that would be great, but I cannot see where we can disregard what the Constitution guarantees just to placate people's sensitivities.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	Christians have to be sensitive to the feelings of others, too.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	She was attributing the long waits at the airports and other changes we have had to get used to, due to the horrible crime committed on 9/11 by some Islamic terrorists, but they do not make up the total Islam religion, so it is wrong to condemn all of them for what some extremists of their religion are doing.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	My answer to her was, if &quot;all&quot; Muslims are to be suspect, then why did we sacrifice 4000+ of our men and women to provide them with a Democracy.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	We are willing to sacrifice our lives to provide them with a democracy but start whining at their building a mosque, or a community center?
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	You tell me where that makes any sense.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	Unfortunately, most of the ones protesting the community center claim that they don't have anything against Muslims, but if you are not able to distinguish between those that were responsible for 9/11 and those who lost loved ones on 9/11, and want to build something that would be good, the claim becomes blurred.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	I just read an article where the leaders of the planned community center have decided against building it there.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	It would seem to me that if they had a malicious agenda they would not have given up.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	However, how do you feel about this:The New York Republican party is also said to be planning a hostile television campaign.Doesn't sound like a bunch of Christians to me.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	What evil could they possible be planning?
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	If they are really such evil motivated people, again, why do most Republicans/conservatives defend the Iraq war?
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	Now you have gone and called these Muslims ignorant.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	That they would not be able to figure out that they are being manipulated, sounds a little condescending and something that I find alarming coming from someone that calls himself a Christian.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	As if, those that oppose the Mosque are the only ones blessed with the ability to see beyond the obvious, and know what is in people's hearts.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	There are other mosques in the area, and also bars.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	So, why does this one hold &quot;special&quot; powers?
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	On Sunday, Jon Kyl (R-AZ) went on “Face the Nation” and suggested, that with all the anchor babies running around, it might be time to scrap the 14th Amendment.Now, the Senate Minority Leader agrees.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is the latest high-profile Republican to say Congress should reconsider the guarantee of birthright citizenship provided by the 14th Amendment, in light of the current debate over immigration reform.http://firedoglake.com/2010/08/03/re...-brown-people/
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	I didn't say there was anything wrong with the Tea Party ideology, I was just reminding the other poster that even if she claims she isn't, her posts say otherwise.But, as far as the right-wing, GOP, Tea Party saving our country, most of those people that are part of the Tea Party were George Bush supporters and we know what he did to the country.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	And all I know of their ideology is &quot;tax cuts for the wealthy&quot;!
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	Pardon the expression but that is a bunch of crap.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	That is the same rhetoric that Rush Limbaugh and the rest of the wealthy Republicans are saying because they want to keep their tax cuts.
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	Wow!
mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	I thought you sounded rational for a while - now you are beginning to sound like the rest of the &quot;scared to death by the GOP media&quot; crowd.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	It’s a run down textile mill.

RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I am suspicious of why its being built were its being build and do not believe the developer.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I fully agree It was not the moderate Muslims fault that their religion is being hijacked by radical elements.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	The developers are within their rights to build it.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	And open and dedicate on 9/11.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	But having the right does not make building it right!
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I feel bad for both sides that there is so much torment over this mosque, however I can understand why the majority of Americans are against it.

RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	Here is a site that I think mirrors my understanding of that scripture.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	it’s different than what you believe, but maybe we can at least understand each others beliefs.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I am guilty of calling Obama a few names out of anger and fear and agree its not anything to be proud of, but I do not think it’s a terribly bad sin.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22417Sorry for not putting it in my own words but I have been writing grant proposals for the missions two days and nights non stop so the least typing I have to do the better!
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	Its 500 feet from ground zero and the call to prayer will easily be heard at ground zero.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I am surprised that you think the 3000 families of the dead and double that number wounded would be lying about the harm this thing is going to do.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	That saddens me that you would think that especially after you are so adamant about offending Obama by calling him names etc. Think about it.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	3000 families that’s at least six to nine thousand people not to mention the survivors of the other attacks.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I don’t think they want to deny anyone their rights, but this kind of thing will breed real anger and hurt.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	All for what?
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	What by protesting the mosque?
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I agree that some liberal politics are more in line with Jesus teachings, but I would not fear Jesus if I were in a peaceful protest march when he came back.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I believe the developers of the mosque has hidden motives for building the mosque too.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I will be interested in seeing where the funding is coming from.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	Christians would not build a church on top of a Muslim cemetery for starters, and I believe they would.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	You are a Christian would you move your church if the situation was reversed?
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I would.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	With all due respect, you seem less and less like a Christian the more you talk.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	The ten commandants plaques are tradition in most cases.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	Congress prays for the tradition as well.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	In most cases it’s the attitude of activist atheists that make Christians bow up.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	In every case I have seen these atheists want to harm or destroy Christianity by forcing ends to long held traditions.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	In many cases they want to harm us not to improve anything.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	Your ideas of obeying corrupt government are not Christian my friend.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I wish you would take some time to read opposing views.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	That link I gave you is a start.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	Remember Jesus was a rebel.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	True I never have.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I am a Reverend.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	So I see and talk to a lot of Christians.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	There is some ignorance out there, however most traditional christians do not hate all Muslims, just the radicalized terrorists that want to impose their religion on us or murder us.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I already did in my first post.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I gave several reasons and I am researching this mosque hoping to run down the funding.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	What would you say if Islamic terrorists were funding part of the Mosque?
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	You are rather insensitive.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	Or maybe I am misreading your post please clarify it?
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	Yea and the Mosque too?
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	The New York Republican party is also said to be planning a hostile television campaign.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	It depends on how hostile the program is I suppose.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	Its all bad stuff.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I fear that the thing will get blown up or after its built something will happen.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I just wish they would not put themselves and the city full of people in harms way and build somewhere else.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	see next post this one was over ten thousand letters over the limit!
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	end of part one!
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	Part two!If they are really such evil motivated people, again, They could be planning or preparing for anything.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	I am not saying they are.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	However I have been around the block a few times and I have found that when peoples deeds do not match their words someone is rotten in Denmark!Too many things do not make sense!
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	We will have to wait and see I suppose.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	God help us we are going to need it.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	You have a very strange way of thinking, not real bad just strange.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	Absolutely no disrespect meant!
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	However, if I was casually reading your posts I would think that you were a secular humanist atheist.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	Not a immoral atheist/SH, but an atheist nevertheless Most conservatives must think the Iraq war was worthwhile.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	I don’t and I do lean conservative.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	Huh?
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	Did you read my disclaimer?
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	Where did I call the Muslims ignorant ? I hope that is not your words in my mouth!
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	Oh only God will go to heaven and who will not.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	So if I were you I would not be throwing rocks cause you sure are living in a glass crib (house)!
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	No that’s not what I said.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	Muslims as well as Christians follow their leaders.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	I do not trust the developers etc. The general population of Muslims are wonderful people, which I have said over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over ! Even posting a disclaimer!
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	Because its being dedicated on 9/11 being built on nearly on top if not on top of the remains of victims, because the funding is hidden and they will not reveal it, because of the name of the center.
RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	And there is more.Thanks for your reply and write soon!ra
Jollee	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1408	I THINK Bush KEPT A SMALL AMOUNT OF SOLDIERS IN Afghanistan BECAUSE HE WAS NOT PLANNING ON PROCEEDING WITH THAT SENSLESS WAR......
Jollee	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1408	HE THOUGHT HE WOULD PLACE CREDENCE IN OUR BORDERS, AND PULL OUR MEN FROM That region since their is no grounds to fight, their are holes, heat, and deflection, a war is stupid to fight in that region of the world, our men are much more important....JolleeNOTE: Although Obama said this Afghanistan war was the right war!
RevAnarchist	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1409	Hi Jolee.
RevAnarchist	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1409	Well at least in Afghanistan we were killing the goons that supported the Taliban cowardly murderous actions of 9/11.
RevAnarchist	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1409	The same cannot be said for Iraq two though.

RevAnarchist	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1409	I like a forty five for conceal carry because although its heavy its thin, thin enough to were a t over it.
RevAnarchist	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1409	That big bullet is from a full size .50 browning Machine Gun round (BMG)

Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1411	Are you saying that the model 1911 .45 caliber bullet is the same as the Browning .50 bullet?
Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1411	Not the complete round, but just the bullet itself.If so, you haven't any clue about weapons at all, and are simply a child trolling on this site.
Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1411	The only differences in the bullets are, different diameters, different lengths, different weights, different shapes, and cannot be fired from the same gun, either .45, or .50.
Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1411	The similarities are that they are both called bullets.
mertex	BigBob	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1412	First, I wish you would learn how to post - it would make it a lot easier to respond to you if you used the conventional method provided by PF.And, to answer your question - No, it doesn't make sense.
mertex	BigBob	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1412	If you are lumping all Muslims together as responsible for 9/11, then pray tell why in the hell are we killing our soldiers to provide &quot;Muslims&quot; in Iraq with a democracy.
mertex	BigBob	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1412	That is what doesn't make any sense.Conservatives cheer and whoop it up that 4000+ soldiers have given their lives to give Muslims in Iraq a democracy and then whine, (*)(*)(*)(*)(*) and revolt over Muslims building a community center.
mertex	BigBob	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1412	So, you blame all &quot;Muslims&quot; for what 19 Al-Qaeda terrorists did?
mertex	BigBob	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1412	That figures.
mertex	BigBob	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1412	Ignorance abounds.The September 11 attacks (often referred to as September 11th or 9/11) were a series of coordinated suicide attacks by al-Qaeda upon the United States on September 11, 2001.
mertex	BigBob	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1412	On that morning, 19 al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial passenger jet airliners.
mertex	BigBob	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1412	So, are you suggesting that all Islam Mosque's in the US are dangerous and should be destroyed?
mertex	BigBob	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1412	Your comment doesn't make sense.
mertex	BigBob	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1412	I think your comments are convoluted.
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	The fact that you ignore all the antics of the Tea Party, the crazy whacko's like Sharon Angle and her off the wall suggestions, the rantings of Palin and Michelle Bachmann and claim that the Tea Party is somehow the answer to America's problems is what is truly laughable.
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	The way they bow at the knee at the mention of his name would make one wonder.

mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	The near instantaneous growth of the tea party after the elections was because of the &quot;fear&quot; and &quot;anger&quot; that a &quot;black&quot; man was now at the helm.
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	And the instantaneous support geared at Palin (Tea Party fave), is another indication that the Tea Party is not really interested in people who exercise frugality to reflect their conservatism, but rather in someone that uses catchy phrases, made-up words and does not practice conservatism in their own life.
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	Your rantings are truly comical.
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	There is none more incompetent than Bush, and certainly McSame, who was not even able to tell the state of the economy when it was at the point of collapse, nor his Caribou Barbie who doesn't even read the newspapers and prides herself on foreign policy because she thinks she can see Russia from her back porch, can compare with Obama's intelligence, eloquence and capabilities.
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	That is the dream of right-wing fanatics of Bush, because they would love for someone to replace that Bozo in the &quot;worst President&quot; category, unfortunately, it doesn't look like it is going to happen.
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	Already, Obama has been given accolades that Bush doesn't even know how to pronounce.Obama 15th Greatest President
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	Funny that you should mention that, being that Bozobush is known for having taken the most time off than any other president.Vacationing Bush Sets Record on Time Off
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	That would have been Bush, Obama's staff continues to work when he is on vacation.
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	It is the constant sniping and whining from the &quot;right&quot; that wears on him, but he is resilient enough to withstand all that vitriol.

Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1416	But if you would go and SEE for yourself, you would see people displaying slurring signs being asked, in no uncertain terms to get out and stay out.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1416	And they get out and stand in front of the liberal cameras.

Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1418	Same as someone saying it is not a community center.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1418	It is a community center AND a mosque.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1418	So it IS a mosque.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1418	Saying its not a mosque, only a community center is like saying a Catholic Church is a Bingo parlor.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1418	Bingo gets played but it is a church, first and foremost.And the fiasco in NY is a mosque, first and foremost.
onalandline	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1420	This is so true.They won't campaign on HCR, bailouts, or the stimulus, because they know none of them are popular with The People.
onalandline	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1420	That just leaves what you mentioned: Bush...oh, and the racist Tea Party movement.I certainly hope they will not continue to campaign on &quot;Hope and Change&quot; because we can see where that is getting us.

mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1422	Sure it's free speech, that is why the racists are able to carry their racist signs and get a free pass from the rest.
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1422	Typical Republican/conservative response - blame the Democrats, they infiltrated our party and they were the ones with the signs, right!
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1422	They capture it on video - I don't have to be there to see the racist signs and they interview people, so I can then hear their &quot;lost&quot; look and dumb answers.
mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1422	America is getting to see just how whacky the Republicans have gotten.

Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1423	Do you mean the America that has a 60/40 disapproval rating against obama?
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1423	That America.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1423	Or the 20% of Americans that trust the Democrats?
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1423	That America?ORAnd this one is hilarious,The America that now sees a 45 to 44 approval rating of Bush over obie the idiot.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1423	That America?In the USA we have 2 newspaper that lean right.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1423	ALL the rest are very to extremely leftist and do nothing but run what amounts to commercials for liberal ideas.We have one TV station that leans right, but does present the other side.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1423	All the rest of TV is exactly like the leftist newspapers.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1423	On radio there are some right leaning to very right wing talk shows.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1423	And the same can be said for the left, only there are more of them.So in media matters the left dominates communication by more than 20 to 1.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1423	Maybe 100 to 1.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1423	Yet, America, does not believe the bill of goods the left is selling.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1423	America hears your story 20 or more times for every time they hear the story from the right, yet they side with the story from the right.
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1423	Is the right that much more convincing, or is the right simply pointing out what the intelligent nation can see for itself.You want more respect from America?
Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1423	Stop insulting their intelligence.

Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1453	It was written because of the way Americans were even then universally hated worldwide.

Dan40	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1463	But the liberal mindset is that if a suggestion, or plan, does not fit their liberal ideology,not only is it ignored.
Dan40	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1463	They ignore it so completely, they act like, and CLAIM, that no suggestions were ever offered.

Dan40	rsay32	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1465	I rest my case!

<b>rsay32</b>	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1471	They seem to have based their entire strategy on doing and saying whatever they think will most obstruct and/or tear down Obama and the democratic party.

GodfatherN1	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1500	because when we had a surplus G.W. cut taxes, increased spending, and took a machete to regulations.
GodfatherN1	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1500	When Obama took office right after the http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=IE&amp;h...&amp;v=mEkY7_i7MJs.
GodfatherN1	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1500	Now, instead of raising taxes when we had a surplus and the economy was good, it was thrown away, dribbled into haliburton and the banks.
GodfatherN1	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1500	Because the Bush tax cut for the rich expired 1.4 years into Obama's term, it was meant to make him look like he was raising taxes in a time in recession when in fact it was just a ploy to make the democratic president, whoever it was look bad, because even Bush knew after the havic he knew he'd create no republican would take office after him.
GodfatherN1	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1500	So is Obama perfect?
GodfatherN1	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1500	no. Was he dealt a bad hand?

GodfatherN1	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1500	no, but honestly I think republicans would be even worse, historically speaking than the man in office now.

Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1501	Now, all they can do is hobble around on crutches blaming Obama for their inability to run the marathon without tea party help.

Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1502	There is no Tea Party like a Democrat Party or Republican Party.

Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1502	How to fix those things and many, many others are points of disagreement in the various tea parties, same as they are in society in general.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1502	Now some have used the name Tea Party for their own political purposes and gain.

onalandline	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1524	The report also finds that Obama's proposal would reduce economic output by $341 billion and create over $68 billion in lost wages nationwide.&quot;Though politicians think they are selectively targeting 'Big Oil' with these energy tax proposals, they would actually devastate thousands of small American businesses nationwide as well as the workers who depend on them,&quot; Mason said in prepared remarks.

onalandline	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1524	The only cuts that would be allowed to expire as scheduled would be those on people making $250,000 per year or more, or roughly 2 percent of taxpayers.TPM has the exchange, from &quot;Face the Nation&quot;:Bob Schieffer: &quot;I want to make sure I heard what you said correctly: you're saying that you are willing to vote for those middle class tax cuts, even though the bill will not include ... extending the tax cuts for the upper bracket American.&quot; Rep. Boehner: &quot;Bob, we don't know what the bill's going to say, alright?
onalandline	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1524	If the only option I have is to vote for those at 250 and below, of course I'm going to do that.
onalandline	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1524	But I'm going to do everything I can to fight to make sure that we extend the current tax rates for all Americans.&quot;That certainly looks like the President winning a game of chicken with the Republican minority, especially given that Democratic members of Congress (Rep. Joe Courtney, for example) have lately sounded resigned to the likelihood that they will have to vote to extend all the cuts, even on the rich, since doing nothing would result in hiking taxes on the middle class.
onalandline	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1524	And since Republicans, by simply folding their arms and saying no to anything but the full slate of tax cuts, would force Democrats to choose between extending a boon for multimillionaires or delivering nothing and handing their opponents another club to use in the fall campaigns.Why would Boehner blink?Perhaps because, as with so many other issues in the last year, the Senate will carry the day.Today, here's Sen. Joe Lieberman, a registered Democrat who makes a lot of registered Democrats see red, explaining that he'll be holding out for the same thing Boehner is: extending the cuts for everybody.More: http://www.theday.com/article/201009...0403/100919940

Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1540	Some &quot;pet&quot; agenda of theirs is ALWAYS 'necessary.'We already have 50% too much Federal Govt NOW.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1540	Step one is to cut that back, along with the massive expense too much Govt generatesThe average private sector job, where 100% of all our goods are produced, pays $63,000.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1540	with benefits.The average Federal employee job, where nothing is produced, pays $121,000.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1540	with benefits.That should make it obvious to EVEN a liberal that cutting the Govt is a better way to go than taxing the private sector.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1540	Since the private sector already has to pay every cent of that $121,000.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1540	Federal largess.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1541	So you are (*)(*)(*)(*)(*)ing about deficits, but won't support raising revenues to reduce them.Typical hypocritical conservative political bull(*)(*)(*)(*).
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1542	&quot;Typical hypocritical conservative political bull?&quot;$63K to $121K and you want to give them more money?Typical liberal lunacy AND BULLSH!TI am 100% for having revenues to support the Govt.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1542	As soon as the Govt is reduced to a proper size, we can increase taxes for the express purpose of paying down the debt.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1542	Increase taxes without decreasing Govt, and we will ONLY get MORE spending.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1542	They're spending money they don't HAVE like drunken sailors.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1542	What would they do with more money??
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1542	Increase the Federal revenues by 10% and they'll spend 12% more than now.CUTS FIRST, then we'll KNOW what the taxes NEED to be.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1543	Sure.

Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1543	In the meantime keep those tax cuts and keep running up debt.All that conservative whining about deficits is nothing but hypocritical political horse(*)(*)(*)(*).

Eighty Deuce	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1550	And then we went from bad to worse in 2008.
Eighty Deuce	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1550	That is also what is currently on the plate.

jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1559	No.
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1559	You are spending someone else's money on needs.
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1559	You are spending your own money on things you don't need (wants).
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1559	You are justifying taking someone else's money so you can buy beer and video games, classic liberal.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	Yes.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	I am justifying getting food stamps so I can afford to buy things other than just food.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	As such I am helping the economy more than I would be if I wasn't on food stamps and only spending money on food.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	I have great pride in my decision to get food stamps because I am helping America get back on track.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	If more of our nation's poor took advantage of government assistance programs designed specifically for them then then even more businesses would benefit.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	Demand would go up.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	And businesses would be forced to expand to make up for the new demand.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	Which means more jobs which ultimately means less people dependent on food stamps.Food stamps also allows me to be independent from my parents.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	Who can't afford to take care of me. Which means they too can spend money on things like paying off their mortgage so they don't become another foreclosure statistic.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	Thank god food stamps exist so that people like me who struggle with academics and require lots of time studying can afford to go to school and eat at the same time.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1561	What total rationalizing bullcrap, You are doing NOTHING for the economy.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1561	The money you're using to buy things &quot;other than food&quot; is not doing anything extra for the economy.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1561	Because someone earned that money AND the right to spend it as they wished, but it was taken from them in the form of taxes to buy food stamps for you.As my signature says, 2 people spending one person's money DOES NOT help the economy.
bacardi	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1564	I quoted the wrong post LOLYou are sounding like the non-believers that thought the housing bubble would go on forever!

CommonSense184	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1566	Instead of taking food stamps and then spending your time surfing the web explaining how in a round about way you are helping the economy, you could simply go out and get a job.
CommonSense184	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1566	My parents said they couldn't afford to keep me under their roof forever, so I decided to go to college so I could get a job and MAKE MY OWN MONEY.
CommonSense184	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1566	There is no way you can say that getting a job and then spending the money from that job is not helping the economy.
Iriemon	bacardi	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1568	Not at all.
Iriemon	bacardi	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1568	I had opportunities by buy real estate in the 2005-07 time frame and wouldn't touch it.You are sounding like the non-believers that think the gold bubble will go on forever!
TheTaoOfBill	Eighty Deuce	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1569	Food stamps wouldn't exist if it didn't benefit businesses.
TheTaoOfBill	Eighty Deuce	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1569	That's the whole reason we still have food stamps.
TheTaoOfBill	Eighty Deuce	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1569	To allow our poor to spend money on things they wouldn't be able to afford otherwise at minimal cost to businesses.
TheTaoOfBill	Eighty Deuce	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1569	I am indeed helping the economy
TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	I'm glad you could handle a full time job and full time school at the same time.
TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	I cannot.
TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	When I tried my GPA plummeted.

TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	So I choose not to work.
TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	Just like plenty of other college students.
TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	And there is nothing wrong with it.
TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	The government will be taking way more in taxes from me after I graduate than the amount I get in food stamps.Also I would not be able to get through college without this assistance.
TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	Which means I wouldn't be able to make the high salary I plan to achieve after I graduate.
TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	Which means the government would be missing out on hundreds of thousands of tax dollars during my career.
TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	So yes.
TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	on many factors getting food stamps is helping the economy.
TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	Not only the business end but it is helping it to gain more revenue in the future.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1571	And thanks to those food stamps I can afford to go to college to get a high salary job which will have high taxes which will be used to pay for some other college kid's food stamps.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1571	It's an economic fact that more money is pumped into the economy thanks to food stamps than the program itself costs.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1571	That's why there isn't a politician in their right mind suggesting we get rid of it.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1571	Only conservatives who don't understand how economics work.
Taxpayer	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1573	A lot of truth in that.
Taxpayer	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1573	Like most things, it's a matter of incentives.
Taxpayer	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1573	Politicians have an incentive to give people what they want and American's consistently want more than they can afford.
Taxpayer	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1573	As long as politicians are allowed to borrow money, the inevitable result is short term patches, snowballing debt, and an eventual crash.
Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1574	You really think those tax dollars &quot;pumped into&quot; the economy wouldn't have been spent had the government not forcibly taken them from people in order to give you the privilege of spending someone else's money?
Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1574	The reason politicians don't shut down this type of forced charity is not because of some greater economic good, it's because more voters want a free ride than are being abused by our tax system.
Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1574	They keep it going to get votes, stay in office, and collect an unearned paycheck.
Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1574	You can, but odds are you won't.
Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1574	The fact that the height of your ambition is to get a salary rather than trying to really make an impact on the economy suggests you'll never pay enough in taxes to even equal what you take out of the government much less help someone else.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1575	An economic fact that more money is pumped into the economy thanks to food stamps, than the program costs.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1575	That is not only a blatant lie, it is also impossible.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1575	It cannot pump anything IN after the same program took the money OUT of the economy.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1575	Believe the liberal bullsh!t if you wish or make up nonsense as you go along.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1575	I went to college working 2 jobs, 1 full time, 1 part time.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1575	AND had a wife and 2 kids.

Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1575	Its called personal responsibility and pride, or at least it used to be.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1575	But I'm guessing you don't really know anything about that.

jthorp24	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1576	But, of course, he needs money for video games

Dan40	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1577	One from my Dad, &quot;The more you carry in your head, the less you'll have to carry on your back.&quot; And one of my own, &quot;The more you do, the more you can do.&quot;And with age, I've found that the opposite of mine is also true, &quot;The more you sit, the more you have to sit.&quot;
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	No.
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	You're wrong.
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Food stamps do benefit the economy.
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	This is an economic fact.http://money.cnn.com/2008/01/29/news...ysis/index.htmhttp://www2.hickoryrecord.com/news/2...nomy-ar-89482/http://www.stateline.org/live/detail...ntentId=401013It is a general trend of capitalism for money to get stuck in high income families.
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Wealth just moves it's way up and once it gets there it does not come back down.
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Wealthy business owners only spend enough to make more money.
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	They do not hire just because they have extra money lying around.
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Because if they did that they might lose money if they are more productive than their demand warrants.
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	So the money gets put in a bank.
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Or an inheritance fund.
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Or some other place where it just sits and makes more money on interest or dividends.
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Sure some of it might &quot;trickle down&quot; but it goes up many times faster than it comes down.The income tax was designed from the start to balance this issue out.
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	It was designed to take money from those who aren't spending it and are instead hording it to make more money for themselves.That money then goes to programs to assist lower income families.
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Whether through food, education, healthcare, or just putting a little extra money in their pockets.This in turn creates more consumers, which means more demand, which forces employers to hire more, which makes businesses sell more product.It's a delicate economic system that ensures everyone gets a piece of the pie.
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Some might get bigger pieces but at least everyone is eating pie.
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	This system keeps our economy healthy.
TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Taking those taxes away only insures the rich get richer and the poor gets poorer.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1579	I'm glad you could.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1579	You're a better man than me. I had two choices.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1579	Work a job and still make barely enough to feed myself while watching my GPA drop below 2.5... or focus all my efforts on school get on government assistance and watch my GPA go to 3.3.Sorry.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1579	The choice is clear.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1579	3.3 is a way nicer GPA.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1579	And I'm not going to sacrifice that so I can make minimum wage when I'm doing just fine living off food stamps and loans.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1579	It means I'll be in more debt when I get out of school.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1579	But I'll have an easier time finding a job because of my GPA and the fact that I had time to be the president of a student organization.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1580	I went to community college for 2 years to get all my gen eds out of the way for basically free (state paid my way).

Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1587	One of the most perverse assertions I've ever heard, too often repeated by those who are unable to earn the lifestyle they demand.More accurately, wealth moves from those that consume much and produce little to those that consume less less than they produce.
Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1587	This isn't a flaw in capitalism, it isn't about money getting &quot;stuck.&quot; It happens because some participants in our economy provide insufficient value to earn money but feel they have a right to spend it.
Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1587	Arbitrarily taking wealth from those who deliver value and gifting it to those who don't doesn't balance out some inherent flaw in capitalism, it masks and excuses the actual failure.
Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1587	The failure isn't that some citizens are &quot;hording&quot; dollars, it's that others are failing to provide anything worth the dollars they covet.If you truly think our economy is best served by maximizing consumption at the expense of productivity, explore the extreme of your theory.
Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1587	If all wealth was collected weekly under a single tax and then evenly redistributed -- how would our economy fair?
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1589	Did the Democratic National Committee take a poll?

frodly	REDRUM	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1591	It was a culmination of 30 years of bad economic policy beginning with Ronald Reagan, continuing through HW Bush and Clinton, and ultimately ending in Bush's administration.

frodly	REDRUM	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1591	But if you are capable of thinking critically, you will realize that is nonsense, and try to actually evaluate policy independently and intelligently.
frodly	REDRUM	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1591	Then if you wanted to blame Obama for the fact that the economy has not recovered more quickly(he could certainly have done more), or the fact that he reformed health care without actually making health care more affordable and accessible for the average person, or that he has failed to competently regulate the banks, etc then I would say you certainly have a point.
frodly	REDRUM	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1591	But if you want to blame Obama for a recession that was already happening before he took office, you are going to have to be incredibly dishonest.

SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1599	&quot;Reagan got plenty of good press- reporters loved him.
SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1599	And yes the economy was showing signs of imporvement- as is our current economy.
SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1599	&quot;RR didn't even have Fox to present a positive view.&quot;Yeah, I love how you spin Fox as the balancing act.
SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1599	Fox is just a propaganda arm for the RNC- pretty much the same as MSNBC is for the DNC.
SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1599	People were saying pretty much this same stuff about Reagan at this point, and it all turned around.
SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1599	Saint Reagan started off with a screwed up economy and was there for the turn around.
SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1599	Obama started off with a screwed up economy and will be here for the turn around too.But if it hasn't turned around- well then the voters can vote him out of office.
SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1599	Thats how things are done via the Constitution.

sec	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1600	I'm sure it was the former
TheTaoOfBill	sec	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1601	No he claimed we spent 111 million on 54 jobs.
TheTaoOfBill	sec	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1601	I would like to see a source that says we spent 111 million on 54 jobs.Not we spent 111 million on 54 jobs and oh yeah we bought brand new infrastructure too.
TheTaoOfBill	sec	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1601	I want a source that says we spent 2 million per job.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1602	LA got $111 million in Stimulus money and they saved or created 54 jobs is exactly what I said and is exactly the case.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1602	Nowhere at any time did I say anyone was being PAID $2 million.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1602	Read what it says, not what you'd prefer it said.FROM the LA Times, an acknowledged far left publication:&quot;As Tim Cavanaugh noted previously, L.A.&#8217;s comptroller has issued two briefs indicating that two city agencies have so far managed to create just 55 jobs with $111 million in stimulus money.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1602	Now the Los Angeles Times follows up, noting that the real worry, according to the comptroller, is that the agencies are not spending money fast enough:&quot;The first report I heard was 54 jobs, the LA Times says 55 jobs, close enough for me.
Jollee	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1603	Jollee, California
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1604	So in other words the stimulus was used to pay for infrastructure that cost 111 million dollars.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1604	A more reasonable price.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1604	Infrastructure improves economies by giving business more efficient commerce routes.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1604	That money isn't JUST for the jobs.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1604	And you are bending the truth for your political agenda.

Iriemon	The Mello Guy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1607	They made you think that all $111 million was spent and only 55 jobs created.What's really happened is the bulk of that money has been allocated, but not spent, and is waiting for the projects to be OKed, then the money will be spent and over 230 more people put to work.When you've been deceived by the same source over and over again, at what point do you stop gullibly accepting anything they say as if it were the word of the Lord?
Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	False.
Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	Obama has cut taxes.
Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	He didn't set the sunset provisions in the Bush tax cuts.
Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	Bush was President when that happened and obama was not even in the Senate when Bush signed it into law.
Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	I've searched all through government websites and have not found anything called &quot;Obamacare.
Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	But, the health care reform law that President Obama signed will slow the growth of health care costs for our country and will help reduced deficit spending.
Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	That's assuming those big spenders in the GOP don't gain control of the government.
Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	Which shows what a failure bush and the GOP are on national defense and budget issues.
Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	They start a war in Afghanistan as the WoT, then (*)(*)(*)(*) near stop it to start a war on Iraq, that had nothing at all to do with terrorism or our national defense, then allowed al Qaeda/Taliban to grow strong after having them on the run.
Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	Untrue.
Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	Almost a third of the deficits can be attributed to Bush policies, another third to the Bush recession/financial implosion lowering the economic activity and tax collections.
Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	And a third in fixing the damage left behind.
Dan40	Shanty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1610	Would you be so kind as to list some of the US Federal Govt programs that have become deeply involved in the private sector and have reduced, controlled, or slowed the increase of costs.
Dan40	Shanty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1610	You may use any programs from 1776 until today and list as many or as few as you wish.
Taxpayer	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1611	I am not a supporter of Obama or his health care bill, but to answer your question I'd argue that the post office is one example.
Taxpayer	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1611	Every year, I sit down with carriers from UPS and FedEx to hammer out an agreement for shipping in the coming year and the existence of the post office as an inferior but sufficient fall back option keeps ever rising costs from both companies in check in a way that competition between the two does not.
Taxpayer	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1611	Real health care reform could have provided a similar inferior but sufficient health service for our citizens that had a similar effect on our health care industry.
Taxpayer	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1611	Sadly, we got Obamacare instead.
Dan40	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1612	According to the US Govt Accounting Office, Not FOX, not the tea party, not any right wing media or publication.
Dan40	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1612	LOSSES for the USPS in 2008 $2.8 BILLION, 2009 $3.0 BILLION, and 2010 looks to be worse.
Dan40	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1612	So whatever savings you THINK you're getting by playing the USPS off private carriers, is more than offset in the taxes needed to support the failing USPS.
Dan40	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1612	But probably, more than any other Govt office, the USPS is trying to be competitive.
Dan40	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1612	But in the real business world, trying to be competitive, but failing, meant bankruptcy.
Dan40	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1612	Now if you're well connected, it means bailout.
Dan40	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1612	If not well connected, bankrupt.
kreo	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1613	Yes, but it is good for the consumers, because it increase competition and decrease shipping cost so it facilitates business overall.
kreo	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1613	That means more money is getting in to the treasury.

Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1619	I have tuned in to him just as I have tuned in to Chris Matthews.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1619	And I have never watched a complete Matthews show either.I do not base anything I say on any statement by Glen Beck, unless unknowingly so, since Beck is on daily and has hours and hours to say things that I do not know he said.But can you cite a single made up fact that Beck has said?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1619	Not a contrary OPINION, but a provable fact, showing that Beck lied?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1619	There may be many, there may be few, there may be none, I do not know.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1619	But since you made the statement, I assume you have FACTS, not opinions, to back up your statement.DO YOU?

Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	Insurance is now regulated before obamacare and was before b.o. was born.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	The regulations on pre-existing conditions are to PROTECT the healthy MILLIONS from the high costs of the few sick.

Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	YES!.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	Is that very tough on the few sick with pre-existing conditions?
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	Sadly yes.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	Life is tough, no regulation will ever or can ever change that.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	However it is only those that have not had group insurance that are in danger of pre-existing exclusions.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	If one has ANY group policy and changes jobs, the new insurer has had to cover them as long as they have had &quot;CREDIBLE COVERAGE&quot; for the 18 months before changing carriers.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	That is and was the law.Same as lifetime coverage limits.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	For an insurance company to set a approval-able rate, REQUIRED BY LAW, they have to know what their EXPOSURE is. So if it is a $2 million lifetime cap, the insurance company KNOWS their max exposure and knows what factor to add in to the premium to cover that.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	These are long standing laws before the actual birth, wherever it was, of obummer.Now the obamacare bill stops pre-existing exclusions and lifetime caps.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	Meaning 100% certain that premiums WILL go up.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	THEY ALREADY ARE GOING UP!!
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	UNEMPLOYMENT is down 1/2 percent???&quot; From May through August, thejobless rate remained in the range of 9.5 to 9.7 percent.&quot;And in reality has stayed in the same range for more than a year.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	So the BLS, not me, says you don't know what you're talking about.Fluctuating between 10% and 9.5% is FLUCTUATING, not going down.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	Or is that liberal math?
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	10% MINUS 9.7% EQUALS 1/2 PERCENT?
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	Not in the real world.
TheTaoOfBill	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1634	Yup.

Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1635	But as time went on and he became more and more revealed as both arrogant without any reason to be arrogant, AND sadly incompetent at the same time, his approval fell down to his sheeple base of about 46%.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1635	That was over a year ago.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1635	Slowly some of the sheeple base has been opening their eyes and over the last year he has slowly gone down to 42%.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1635	After Nov. he WILL drop into the 30's and then he is finished.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1635	Even the Democrat National Committee will then acknowledge him as the empty suit in the White House.

Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1635	Are you aware that almost universally, Democrats running for re-election are avoiding any mention of obummer or his policies.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1635	They're trying to make themselves look like pseudo-Republicans.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1636	ANY republican ALWAYS does better than a specific republican.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1636	Because no two republicans can agree on what it means to be republican.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1636	There are the Ron Paul libertarians.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1636	There are the moral right Christian conservatives.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1636	The younger more progressive conservatives.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1636	And everything in between.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1636	When you put Obama up against any specific republican candidate he generally wins.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	That is not true.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	Beginning with the Dem tax increase in 1993, tax revenues grew far faster than the economy.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	Spending however, grew much slower than the economy, a trend that continued thru 20001.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	That is the difference between a conservative and a liberal.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	The conservative says you have a pre-existing condition?
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	Tough just get sick and die.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	The liberal says everyone shares the risk.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	We are all Americans.That's why I'm proud to be a liberal.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	Unemployment rate:Oct 2009 10.1%Aug 2009 9.6%http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htm10.1-9.6 = 0.5% or 1/2%.I stand by my post.
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1638	A pre-existing condition is something that presented itself before you chose to have the insurance.A person applying for insurance for a pre-existing condition is taking no risk, they know they will use the services they are asking to receive at a discount.
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1638	That cost savings to them will be paid for by others, who risked buying insurance without knowing if they would develop the need.The conservative asks why didn't you buy insurance before you developed this condition when we could all share the risk?
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1638	The liberal answers because I didn't want to risk my money, I'd rather have you take care of me.That's why I'd be embarrassed to be a liberal.
Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1639	That is not necessarily true at all.
Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1639	That is the idea behind insurance.
Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1639	The liberal answers that I had it and lost my job or was dropped by my carrier.
Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1639	The conservate answers then go ahead and die.
Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1639	That's why I'd be ashamed to be a conservative.
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1640	Then you have no problem.
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1640	When you lost your job you chose COBRA to continue your coverage or you bought new insurance when you were dropped by your carrier.
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1640	In either case, you had uninterrupted coverage and so your current carrier does not consider your current ailment as a pre-existing condition.
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1641	I think you are confusing the ideas of insurance and charity.
Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1642	I'm not.
Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1642	The purpose of insurance is to spread the risk among a population.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1643	The purpose of insurance is to TRANSFER the risk to an insurance company in exchange for a premium.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1643	Insurance companies are FOR PROFIT organizations.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1643	[I realize that the words, FOR PROFIT, are very confusing for liberals.]
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1643	It means that they MUST take in more money in premiums than they pay out in claims and operating costs.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1643	It also means that they must keep the premiums at a sellable amount.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1643	It is not necessary for you to believe that, but it is absolutely true.Insurance companies COULD insure anybody, or everybody, for everything.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1643	But NO ONE would be able to afford the premium they would HAVE to charge in order to be profitable.
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1644	Then you've definitely confused them.
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1644	As I pointed out, the person you are describing has no risk.
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1644	His liability is certain.
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1644	You are not spreading out risk, you are simply spreading his definite cost to others.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1645	I think you're getting a little ahead of yourself
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1645	Then you should be proud and happy to pay for your Utopian liberals dreams, yourself, [its called charity] without bothering those of us who know your dreams are impracticable and unworkable, and unsustainable, and we do not wish to waste our resources on stupidity that does not work.In a disaster, TRIAGE, is done because it does the greatest good for the greatest number.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1645	TRIAGE is a FACT of everyday life too.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1645	Not everyone is going to make it.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1645	That is FACT, your liberalism is dream.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1645	In your words:&quot;Oct 2009 10.1%Aug 2009 9.6%&quot;Ahhh, I don't know how to break this to you gently, so I'll just say it.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1645	ITS SEPTEMBER 2010 AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT IS STILL AT THE SAME PLACE!!!!
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1646	No one said anything about insurance companies, but insurance.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1646	I agree insurance companies exists FOR PROFIT.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1646	That means, to MAXIMIZE PROFIT insurance companies will drop people with conditions and try to avoid paying with exceptions in their policies.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1646	And that is why, because insurance companies exist to MAXIMIZE PROFIT they will not cover you if you are old or have a pre-existing condition because you are more likely to get SICK and need HEALTH CARE.So unless your view is that only those who are young and healthy and who can afford to pay for coverage FOR PROFIT insurance companies provide should be able to get HEALTH CARE, this is exactly why a system of private insurance based on FOR PROFIT insurance companies DOES NOT WORK.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	There is no &quot;insurance&quot; without insurance companies.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	And please do not claim Medicare, which is processed through insurance companies for a fee, and Social Security.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	Both of which you want to do cancel.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	And Medicaid which is welfare, not insurance

Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	Your last statement is inane ideological nonsense and false.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	Insurance companies MUST be for profit [I said in a previous post that you wouldn't understand that and obviously you don't] and they do exist and they do work and they have worked for many years.The problem with health insurance specifically is that your kind of liberal thinking has screwed it up.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	You want insurance to be a payor of convenience and it can NEVER be that.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	It must only cover risk, and the more risk we ask it to cover, the MORE expensive it MUST be.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	The present problem is that everyone wants the health insurance company to PAY from the first dollar of charges on.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	That causes the premium to be higher because we are transferring ALL risk to the insurance company.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	When they also have to cover pre ex and no limits, the premiums MUST go MUCH higher.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	There is NO way around that.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	We do NOT ask any other type of insurance to do that, why do we ask health insurance to be a payor of convenience instead of covering our UNACCEPTABLE risk.Would you pay a $200.00 dollar collision premium on a $500 car?
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	No, because the $500.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	RISK is acceptable.Same thing, even if you went to the Doctor every month @ $100.00 per visit and your insurer paid for each visit.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	They MUST charge you a premium that will cover their known risk of what might happen with your health AND that premium also has to be high enough to also cover your $100 per month Doc charges.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	ie the premium MUST be much higher than $1200 per year.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	Probably 2 to 3 times higher since the first $1200 is only recovering their costs.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1648	Sure there is government insurance, like medicare and social security.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1648	Interesting.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1648	So what?
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1648	Interesting.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1648	So what?
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1648	Right.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1648	So the FOR PROFIT insurance company to avoid RISK will cut off the aged and unhealthy.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1648	That is why it DOES NOT WORK.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1649	I'll correct the typo:&quot;Oct 2009 10.1%Aug 2010 9.6%&quot;Thanks!
Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1650	For some persons that will be true.
Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1650	For others its a higher risk.

Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1652	I'd love to hear your explanation of how an economy going from tanking at -7% real and losing 700,000 jobs a month to growing private sector jobs being added is *not* improving.
RevAnarchist	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1653	The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Wednesday shows that 28&#37; of the nation's voters Strongly Approve of the way that Barack Obama is performing his role as president.

I would personally tar and feather him well no, I don't hate him that much and almost feel sorry for him.
RevAnarchist	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1653	At first and during the election (more like a love Obama orgy 100 millionsum') he seemed like an idealist kid that had no experience but lots of dreams.
RevAnarchist	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1653	(his lack of executive and other experience along with his need to be liked nearly destroyed him and us, ie the nation).
RevAnarchist	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1653	The trouble is the wanderlust kid is taking the nation down by implementing his socialist leaning ill thought out idealism or maybe just wishful fiat thinking that those trillions here and trillions there will come from 'somewhere' and he seems to be trying to make us like him the same way a bad father spoils a child.

Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1654	Specifically, what socialist leaning ill thought out idealism has Obama implemented to date that you believe had been tearing the nation down, and do you blame that socialist leaning ill thought out idealism for the fact the economy was tanking at -7% and losing 700,000 jobs per month before Obama ever took office.
Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1656	The Health care program hasn't even gotten off the ground yet.Since you have identified the Health care program as the &quot;socialist leaning ill thought out idealism has Obama implemented to date that you believe had been tearing the nation down&quot;, please explain specifically in your view how that has caused the current economic situation or how it contributed to the fact the economy was tanking at -7% real and losing 700,000 jobs a month before Obama took office.
Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1656	Personally, I can't see how the health care program had one iota to do with the current state of the economy, proving your assertion is nothing more than baseless, partisan political nonsense.
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1658	We are talking about people buying insurance and asking to be covered for conditions that pre-existed their having insurance (if they have in place prior insurance that covered the condition, this is a non-issue).What I have said in my previous post is not true for only some, but for everyone who asks to be covered for a pre-existing condition.Everyone of these people is asking for something beyond insurance, they are not trying to share the risk that they might need treatment with others who also might need treatment.
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1658	They are asking others to pay more, so they can pay less, for treatment they know they will need.If you want to institute this, make the argument.
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1658	But do not characterize this as simply insurance or characterize it as risk sharing -- it is neither.
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1658	It is charity.
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1658	To be clear, I am not saying it is wrong to offer charity.
Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1658	But it is misleading to claim this would be anything other than charity.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	From one side of your mouth you say Medicare and Social Security are INSURANCE.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	But on other threads you claim that the Medicare and Social Security beneficiaries ARE NOT entitled to their benefits even though they paid in to the program all their lives and in the case of Medicare they continue to pay at $100.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	per month per person.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	You want to take away those benefits to reduce the debt.YOU CANNOT HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	That is liberalism 101 and it is wrong now, has always been wrong, and always will be wrong.in&#183;sur&#183;ance (n-shrns)a. Coverage by a contract binding a party to indemnify another against specified loss in return for premiums paid.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	You intimate in previous posts that insurance companies are making a killing.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	Just as your lying clown in the White House constantly claims they are.When the fact is that if insurance companies had a raw material cost like manufacturers do, they could not make it on 3.3&#37; profit.When shown that insurance companies are not making a killing you say, &quot;Interesting, So What?&quot; So what is that is shows your position to be pure ideological nonsense and brainwashing.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	Without any fact to give credence to your nonsense.AGAIN.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	Please read AND comprehend the definition of insurance above.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	It is obvious you have no idea of the concept of insurance.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	If you did understand what insurance IS, you would understand that your arguments have no merit whatsoever.And is it possible that you could actually believe that insurance companies have been in existence for well over 100 years and the politicians have not been massively regulating them for many decades.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	What other 100 plus year old industry has Govt kept their nose out of?
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	RIGHT!
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	NONE, including insurance.Your clown-in-charge lied many times about the man with cancer that had his insurance canceled to avoid the expense by the insurer.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	Every word of that story was a lie.1.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	It was a NEW policy.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	2.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	He had pre-existing conditions that he FAILED to list on the application.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	3 Insurance regulation BY THE STATE GOVTS allows insurers 2 years to investigate a new policy for pre-existing conditions.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	4.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	The man appealed because his pre-ex was not cancer and he had no pre-ex of cancer.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	5.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	The insurance company was totally justified in canceling the policy for cause, BUT THEY DID RELENT BECAUSE THE PRE-EX WAS NOT CANCER.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	They were NOT forced to relent, the insurance company choose to cover the man's cancer treatment and they did.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	6.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	He underwent the full range of cancer treatment, paid for by the insurance company.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	7.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	He lived another 4 years after the completion of treatment.But the lying obummer said his insurance canceled the man's policy and he died FOR lack OF TREATMENT.Total lies to con bad legislation on the public Luckily all but the brainless sheeple know he was lying..Once a policy is in force and past the 2 year look back.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	Insurance companies BY LAW, cannot cancel a health insurance policy for an individual except for non-payment of premium.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon;	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	It's the law of the land, and you seem oblivious to the fact that people that control money are nervous types.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon;	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Even a baseless rumor can cause panic and freeze funds.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon;	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Don't beleive me try to get a moderately large small business loan (in the hundred thousand dollar range).
RevAnarchist	Iriemon;	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	I don't have that kind of money but know those that do and they say banks are sitting on it as do other sources.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	First, with all due respect and accompanying niceties, don't attempt to box me in to your parameters.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	I was making a commentary not a doctoral dissertation or laying out detailed abstract critiquing our economic woes.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	And lastly a request.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Please use quote tags as a matter of common courtesy.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	When someone interprets my bad grammar I don’t know if they are being accurate, as I said here before, I cheated my way through K3&gt; through middle school English, then high school and college English Grammar and sometimes math, and now, because of my ignorance we are all paying for it!
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	So my grammar being bad I understand if you make wrong assumptions etc. Quote tags make it so much easier and lessen the mistaken assumptions and helps everyone.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Ok I found the post number 1654 page number 166 ; Rev said &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'The trouble is the wanderlust kid is taking the nation down by implementing his socialist leaning' &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;That was an opinion and it means I believe Obama is a socialist at heart and will attempt to mould the USA into a socialist nation.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	that the nation will not survive as a socialist country IMO, and by taking it down I meant it won’t be a capitalist representative democratic republic as it is today, but rather some type of socialist Nation, with Obama at the helm of course.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Rev said &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'ill thought out idealism' &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I was suggesting that he thought things would work by the power of his personality and popularity.Rev said &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'or maybe just wishful fiat thinking that those trillions here and trillions there will come from 'somewhere' &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;By that I meant that the our fiat currency is allowing him to spend those trillions, making our loan officers nervous.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	I believe they know that we are printing money to pay for Obamas trillion dollar projects/recovery etcRev said &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'and he seems to be trying to make us like him the same way a bad father spoils a child.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	We really need a tough love parent...um' president not a perhaps well meaning but naive enabler.'

RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	I don’t say that lightly my lively hood depends on how well my two non profit missions and churches perform, all three which use federal grants and private donations.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Now they are performing in the red and have been since the crash.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Well no, my reply/rant was comment just like most of your posts and others here.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Partisan?
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	No again, I vote the issues not the party.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	I know I may sound like I vote by the party but that is incorrect.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	That said (corrected) I agree that the health care atrocity had a demonstrable effect on our economy at the moment, and did not mean to imply that.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	No it's the entire Obama package makes those that have real money nervous.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	I am speaking of corporations and those that lend us gadzillion dollar sums.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Until they have faith and trust in Obama the recovery is going to drag along.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	ra
Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	You think?
Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	Hey, I think we have discovered why Murdoc News constantly puts out the negative, misleading information about the economy!
Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	What is a quote tag?
Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	I quoted your words not because of your grammar but because folks here so often mischaracterize statements, so I try to quote verbatim the relevant statement so as not to mischaracterize.
Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	We've been socialist for 85 years now and done OK, haven't we?
Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	And we need to restore revenues by increasing taxes.Sorry to hear about your churches.
Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	Do churches really get federal $$?
Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	I guess that started during the Bush administration?
Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	I had thought that was unconstitutional.
Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	OK, so its not health care after all that is responsible for tearing the nation down.
Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	We've clarified that.Instead, it is the &quot;entire Obama package&quot; that makes those that have real money nervous that is tearing the country down.How is the &quot;entire Obama package&quot; doing that, and upon want facts or data, if any, do you have to demonstrate that is the cause?
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	I don't think Medicare is akin to Insurance.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	SS is. If I said Medicare was I mis-spoke and withdraw it.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	Medicare is Govt national health care, available only to those over 65.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	It's not wrong at all.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	There is no contract that guarantees you SS or medicare benefits.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	The fact you paid taxes in life does give you entitlements.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	I've never claimed SS is an insurance policy.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	I've said it is social insurance, like insurance the pool resources and provide benefits if and only if certain conditions occur.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	I've intimated nothing of the sort.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	Quit wasting my time with strawmen.I siad that insurance companies are for profit and therefore will endeavor to avoid paying benefits by excluding coverage on those more likely to meet the condition for benefits.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	Because it is irrelevant.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	How do you figure?
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	My position is logical and factually supported.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1666	You do have a sense of humor!
Jollee	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1667	If you worked your entire life, you paid mega money into Medicare, they just borrowed it and spent it wrong!

Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1671	Thanks.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1671	You have a sense of dodging and dancing when you have no argument.
Jollee	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1672	Ha Ha Ha, so funny and maybe true... maybe not......
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	I've lumped all of the above in one quote, since all of it shows you to have no knowledge of the country you live in.The above programs, Medicare, and Social Security are each INSURANCE.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Both are coverage in exchange for premiums.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	One is medical coverage, one is social coverage.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	And they are our ONLY 2 &quot;ENTITLEMENT&quot; programs.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Entitlements are bad mouthed on both sides of the aisle, but what they are lumping in with M &amp;SS are give away programs, which are not entitlements, they are welfare, like subsidized housing, food stamps, Medicaid.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Our 2 real entitlement programs have PAID their premiums.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	It is the politicians, both parties, that have blown the Med.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	&amp; SS money on many things including the welfare programs listed above, that do not pay in a penny but take out Billions per year.But I digress, Medicare and Social Security are insurance programs MANDATED by the Govt.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	We do not have the choice of paying for them or not.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	The premiums are taken in the form of FICA taxes.Are you in any way aware of what F.I.C.A. means?Federal INSURANCE Contributions Act.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	And is separate from income taxes.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	6.2&#37; and 1.45% of income is taken FOR Social Security and Medicare respectively.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	And both are means tested.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Medicare the more you've made in your working life, the more you've paid in, but you receive only the exact same benefit of anyone that made minimum wage for only 40 quarters of their working life.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Plus if you make over $100,000 and you're on Medicare, you monthly premium is higher than people making less.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Plus those in lower income ranges can have premiums lower or waived altogether and co-pays reduced or zeroed.Social Security, the more you made, the more you paid in, the more benefit you receive.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	THAT is means testing.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	And if one is making over $108,000.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	their SS tax stops, as does the accrual of any more benefit.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Yes, those people will get the max SS payout, but they also paid the highest PREMIUMS.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	And if they are still making high incomes they pay income tax on their SS benefits at regular income tax rates on 50% of the benefit, or 85% of the benefit depending on their income.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	People living on SS alone, do not pay any income tax on their SS benefits.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Your every post makes it obvious to all readers that you either do hate the rich or you have been ideologically brainwashed into reciting the present day liberal line.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	In years past the liberal line was TAX BIG BUSINESS.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	But when they realized that the public KNEW that just meant higher prices, liberals changed to the &quot;hate the rich&quot; nonsense.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	And you have quite obviously bought into that stupidity, wholeheartedly.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Again your basic misconceptions about insurance show through.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Excluding coverage for those WITH pre-existing conditions is done, with 100% approval of insurance regulators[elected or appointed politicians], solely to keep premiums lower for those who are transferring risk to the insurance company in exchange for a premium.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Covering anyone already needing treatment is transferring COST, not risk.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	RISK is a necessary factor in the insurance equation.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Insurance companies CANNOT be in the business of taking on COSTS, they have to take on RISK.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Don't know why you are UNABLE to grasp that simple concept.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Your position is one of misconception, and ideological nonsense, and distortions.And I was being kind to say you have a sense of humor.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Your fuzzy glimpse of reality is sad, not funny.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	If I was predisposed to feel sorry for people, I'm not, I'd feel sorry for you
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	I can see your point.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	I'll agree medicare is like insurance to, in a way.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	You seem to have the mistaken impression that a political view that the wealthy ought to pay more taxes equates to hate.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	Of course it doesn't.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	Cost is a function of risk.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	I completely understand that a person who is aged or has a pre-existing condition carries a greater risk of higher cost.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	That is why for profit private insurers will seek to cut out such persons.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	And why a system of private insurance does not work for national heath care.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	I disagree with your opinions.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	Others can decide for themselves.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	I can tell you are not the kind who would feel sorry for people.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1675	And I am very comfortable with that.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1675	Feeling sorry for people instead of demanding they get off their ass and haul their own load is about 70% of our problems in this country.I did the &quot;red thing&quot; because it pleases you so.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1675	See I have a sense of macabre, err, humor too
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1677	There's no legal contract with SS, and I'm pretty sure medicare as well.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1677	Again, I have no surprise you are not the kind would not feel sorry for people and are comfortable with it.It's why you are a conservative and I'm a liberal.

Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1686	Before you make some LAME AZZ excuse for him [the hallmark of his presidency] All the bad past people had &quot;good&quot; reasons for their spending too.

Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1688	What was the good reason for Bush squandering a surplus and running up $ 5 trillion in debt?What was the good reason for Reagan taking a small deficit and quadrupling it and tripling the debt?Obama inherited the worst economic situation since the great depression that mandated fiscal stimulus.I agree he needs to reduce the deficits and should raise taxes and trim spending.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1688	I've said it many times.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	What you cannot comprehend is that they always have a &quot;good&quot; reason.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	Same as obummer has a &quot;good&quot; reason.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	But their good reason AND obummer's good reasons are simply excuses put out by the spenders.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	THERE is no good reasons for spending Trillions we do not have.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	There was no good reason then, there is no good reason now.

Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	What obummer faced and faces is about 1/2 as bad as what Reagan faced.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	Less than half actually.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	Same bad economy, same bad unemployment PLUS massive DOUBLE DIGIT INFLATION.I lived and worked in those days.

Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	Did Reagan BELIEVE he had a good reason for spending like he did?
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	Sure he did.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	But we are paying today for the precedent he set then.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	Same as we will pay for obummer's idiocy.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	We will suffer in the future for obummer's policies today, PLUS inflation WILL run wild again.A chemo treatment that is 100% effective against cancer is useless if it also kills the patient.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	That was oBum's treatment plan except that it is killing the patient AND it is not effective.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	But it IS more expensive than anything else ever tried in history.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1690	During a sever recession there are very good reasons to increase spending.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1690	It creates demand and picks up slack caused by the overreaction of the markets and economy to lessen the full effect of the recession or recessionary spiral into depression.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1690	Interest rates were high because of the Fed's actions to kill inflation, but Reagan inhereted an economy where the relative size of the debt was the lowest in 45 years and the economy was growing at 7+&#37; real.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1690	Obama inherited record deficits, the highest relative debt in 60 years, and an economy tanking at -7% real.Easy choice which one I'd rather walk into.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1690	Depends on what you mean.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1690	Relatively the Govt spent far more on WWII and probably close to the same for Reagans military buildup.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1690	And in perspective, the spending on the stimulus is no more than the cost of the mistaken Iraq war, and really only a couple years extra annual military spending compared to 2000.
jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	Not true.

Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	For example, you can track exactly where the stimulus money is going at http://www.recovery.gov/Pages/home.aspx - &quot;He has/will raise taxes on everyone (no tax cut for 95% of Americans).&quot;Well duh.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Anyone who was elected President in 2008 would have had to raise taxes at some point.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	The Bush tax cuts were simply irresponsible and unsustainable.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	- &quot;He has increased spending/size of government to record levels.&quot;You're talking about the stimulus bill?
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	I will remind you that two years ago economists from all over the political spectrum were warning of the very real danger of a second Great Depression.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	In case you've forgotten your high school history, the Great Depression involved unemployment rates in the neighborhood of 25%, thousands of bank failures, huge numbers of American forced to lived in Hoovervilles - makeshift camps for the homeless.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	You really think averting economic collapse isn't worth spending money on?
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	- &quot;He has /will increase our deficit to record levels.&quot;So a huge recurring, structural deficit to fund tax cuts for the rich is okie-dokie, but a one time emergency expenditure is the end of the world?
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	And weren't you just complaining about taxes being raised?

Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	- &quot;He ignores The People and pushes through legislation any way he can.&quot;Errr, weren't you criticizing Clinton just a few years ago for making policy decisions based on polling?
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	And I seem to recall pretty constant complaints about a &quot;Do nothing Congress.&quot; You should really make up your mind which you want.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	- &quot;He has weakened national security/border security.&quot;How exactly?
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Obama has reduced the stress on a severely overextended US military.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Our world standing has greatly improved and we're seeing much more cooperation both from traditional allies and from other world powers such as Russia and China.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Honestly, just running around the world threatening to bomb anyone we don't like does not make the US any more secure.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Considering that it greatly reduces the credibility of threats of military force, I'd say it does the opposite.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	As for the border, if anything, Obama has increased border enforcement compared to Bush.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	- &quot;He has several proposed policies that will hurt Americans and our economy.&quot;Such as what?
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	I really have no idea what you're on about with this one.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	You consider an economic policy that leads to 9% unemployment rather then 25% to have hurt the economy?
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	How exactly do you figure that?
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	- &quot;He is shunning our allies and kissing the asses of our enemies.&quot;Anyone who ever uttered the words &quot;freedom fries&quot; has absolutely no room to speak on this subject.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Real friends tell you when you're making a mistake.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	People who simply go along with anything and everything you want aren't friends, they're sycophants.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	And have you ever considered actually asking our allies what they think of the matter?
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Obama is very popular in Europe and the rest of the world.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	I happened to be on a trip to England on election day 2008 (I voted by absentee ballot) and when I went to the airport to come back, the guy at the customs desk gave me a hearty congratulations on Obama's election when he saw my US passport.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	As for our enemies, Iran, at least, is in a much, much weaker position now then it was two years ago.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Between internal dissension (Which Obama encouraged by holding out a hand in his inaugural) and growing international opposition (Thanks to Obama engaging in actual *diplomacy*) Ahmadinejad's regime has gone from being on the verge of regional domination to severely hemmed in and with few options.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	- &quot;He continues to spew lies and BS to the American people.&quot;Unless you'd care to provide actual examples, this is a meaningless insult on about the level of accusing Obama of having cooties.To sum up, although Obama has been far from perfect and can certainly be criticized on many points, over all he's done quite a good job under very adverse circumstances.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Yes, the economy still sucks, but you know what?
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	The President can't simply order prosperity to return.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	The US economy is a massive thing with a mind of its own that the government has only limited means to influence.

Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Why Democrats aren't running on this is a puzzle to me. Some commentators seem to think that is too complex an argument for American voters to grasp.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	I sincerely hope they're wrong.So yes, I will very likely vote to re-elect Obama.
Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	And no, I almost certainly wouldn't vote for Palin.

onalandline	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1698	Most folks view Obama as just a typical politician and more of the same.
onalandline	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1698	Obama continues to live in a pipe dream believing his policies are helping our economy.

onalandline	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1698	The scary thing is that I really think Obama thinks he is right with his policies, even though many are against him.
onalandline	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1698	Just speculation.

Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1699	And, when they do -- as I have on occasion -- the DAN-NO rebuttal is more of the same opinionated nonsense.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1699	Like MOST conservatives, your posts reveal that you &quot;think?&quot; posting the same stuff over and over will convince others you have an argument.

jthorp24	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1700	ONE thing
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	First, you don't know what the tea party is. You only know what your brainwashing elitists tell you to think.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	The tea party, simply put, is the overwhelming majority of American Citizens.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	Mainstream America IS the tea party, some actually join, others are just sympathetic to tea party ideas.And everything I posted that elicited your derogatory quote is an accurate depiction of liberal statements.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	Made over and over and over.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	B--O--R--I--N--G!!!!!!
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	Yes conservatives DO have opinions, based in reality and truth.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	Your quote PROVES that liberals have opinions too.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	Based in beautiful theories that cannot continue.You liberals want all things for all persons, beautiful, a wonderful goal.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	Talk to CHARITIES, not Governments.
Sassy	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1702	READERS Please Note!!!Conservatives like to hawk their &quot;views&quot; but seldom supply any &quot;unbiased&quot; sources for their &quot;facts.&quot; Research of their &quot;facts&quot; shows a heavy, fundamental reliance on Republican/Tea Party propaganda.
Sassy	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1702	When challenged for their propaganda, they change the subject or ignore the challenge completely.
Sassy	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1702	Thus, this is NOT debate, but a biased, single minded rehearsed tirade of unfounded, opinionated rhetoric.
Sassy	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1702	Now, I am quick to remind all that it's perfectly OK to have an opinion and to post it no matter how perverse or ill-advised, BUT, in this American democracy, we the people, have the means to research such material and when one does, one is not surprised to discover just how slanted and unfounded conservative propaganda is.Here's an example: Both DAN-NO40 and Onalandline deride the &quot;Stimulus.&quot; How about the report just released today by the WH and confirmed in this article in The Washington Post:Report gives stimulus high marks by Lori Montgomery.
Sassy	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1702	Read it and judge for yourself.

Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	It may be that 20 years is your &quot;Right&quot; time to evaluate the current president, but it's a trifle &quot;long&quot; term for me -- and perhaps for you depending upon your age.I was around when Reagan was president and even tho' I voted for Nixon, I found Reagan to be a B-picture actor &quot;acting&quot; like a president.
Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	His best performance was convincing everyone he was a &quot;good&quot; president.
Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	Further, he likely had Alzheimer's when he was in the WH, and it was reported that he was often caught 'nodding' off during meetings.
Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	Personally, I prefer to depend on someone who CAN be aroused at 2 AM with an emergency.I am an Independent, and I agree that Bratboy Bush was the worst president during my lifetime.
Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	I did not support Obama during the 2008 campaign (I supported Hillary and was very angry with the DNC for taking Texas away from her and 'giving' it to Obama and for ignoring the 18 million votes she got nationally.
Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	I blame Ted Kennedy for that bit of 'political slight of hand.'
Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	I never supported any Kennedy, either).But, there is NO way I can support the political perfidy that permeates the Republican party since Reagan.
Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	These people are 'off the charts' when it comes to reason and proffering their 'facts' as truth.
Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	They are pro-wealth and corporate personhood (Corporations are NOT human and have only one purpose: to make a profit.The Constitution was written FOR the preservation of 'human' life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, NOT profit).It is my opinion that the conservatives on the SCOTUS are a group of anti-Constitutional nincompoops!
Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	The best thing that Obama has done so far,in my view, is to nominate 2 more women to the Court.
Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	These brilliant women have faced the slings and arrows of sex discrimination by the &quot;good ole boys' club&quot; and likely will write opinions based on humanitarian rather than corporate needs when they must judge some of the crackpot laws the Republican dominated Congress passed and both GWB and WJC signed into law.
Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	As for the so called 'blue dog' democrats, they're now simply out of the closet homogametic republicans.
Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	May they rue their votes to their political deathbed.

Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1706	Using it in a manner other than how he meant it IS politics.Simple fact, obummer came in with 69% approval.

Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1717	That's the kind of collective dishonesty that the tea party and their conservative fellow travelers use to spread their unAmerican philosophy of ' political hatred,' and their unreasonable goal to foster governmental turmoil and eventual destruction in a stable democracy.How can the tea party/conservative Republican party justify that philosophy without undermining the Constitutional ideals of 'human' life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and that 'all men (mankind) are created equal?'
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1717	Again, Obama's popularity is NOT the question supporting this thread.

Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1718	And it will, precisely because the media SHOULD be reporting facts and events as they ARE, NOT as they'd like them to be.Rather than vomiting out the pablum your liberal loonies have taught you, you should go and see the tea party for yourself and with an open mind.

Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	You DID NOT get the Democratic/Independent vote EITHER.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	So HOW is it the Republicans fault?
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	Why are you not pointing the finger at your dissenting Democrats?????For well over a year Democrats had held a 60 to 40 super majority.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	Yet they constantly claimed Republicans were blocking everything, a mathematical impossibility.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	Now the Dems hold a 59 to 41 advantage.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	When the vote is 59 to 41, THEN you can gripe about Republicans, but it never is 59-41.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	Get your own group in order, then complain.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	Until then blaming Republicans is just another in the long, long, line of liberal excuses and avoiding the blame for their own shortcomings.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	I couldn't possibly agree with you more, and I am a liberal.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	It is a lie to convince people who are left wing to continue to support the corporatist, decidedly not left wing Democratic party.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	So they lie and blame Republicans.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	Well many Democrats are not that stupid.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	Many Democrats understand math, and know that for about a year, Democrats could have done whatever they felt like.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	They could have passed progressive health care reform, that included a public option.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	Health care reform that benefited the American people, by insuring the uninsured and lowering premiums for the rest of us.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	Instead what we got was a handout to insurance companies.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	They continue to try to blame Republicans for their lack of progress, but the reality is they are owned by the same corporate and special interests that Republicans are.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	They have simply convinced people they are the party of the people.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	That is a lie, we have 2 parties of the rich and powerful, and none who are for the poor or more importantly the middle class.
Agent Zero	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1722	When we really think about it, it's astonishing how much influence the Blue Dogs in the Senate have.
Agent Zero	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1722	Their actions eventually led to the public option being dropped, resulting in poor legislation that is a major reason Democrats are being (*)(*)(*)(*)ted on in the polls.
frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1723	I don't even think it is only the Blue Dogs anyways.
frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1723	Ultimately the Blue Dogs are beholden to the Democratic party leadership.
frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1723	If the party does not fund their campaigns, they will have a hard time raising money themselves, unless they are particularly charismatic.
frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1723	It is the fault of the Democratic party leadership.
frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1723	They could have gotten a better health care bill through if they had the political will to do so, but they didn't.
Agent Zero	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1724	Well that's included in the whole situation but allow them to do what they want and we see what happened.
Agent Zero	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1724	If I'm Reid, Pelosi, Obama, and the DNC leadership I tell them to back this or we're gonna have to end up passing crappy legislation, which is what happened.
Agent Zero	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1724	Ultimately, one party is out of their collective minds, and the other is too much of a wuss to get anything substantial done.
CRIMSON MASK	Sly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1726	More than conservatives.
CRIMSON MASK	Sly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1726	Obama has been at odds with the American people on almost every issue since he took office.
CRIMSON MASK	Devil505	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1727	Really?
CRIMSON MASK	Devil505	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1727	The guy has been giving campaign speeches and pushing his agenda at full speed since taking office.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	So we subtract $288 billion from the total stimulus and divide that remainder by the 2.5 million jobs that will eventually be created and we get that each job has cost $210,400.00.This you consider good?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	This you consider a good reason to go another trillion dollars in debt?The New Orleans levees?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	We have spent many billions to fix and improve the levees over the last 100 years.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	Not 10 cents on the dollar has ever reached the levees.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	LA. AND N.O. could teach Chicago things about corruption and graft, and that is really saying something.And the infrastructure?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	Indeed do the repairs, that was what the &quot;shovel ready&quot; projects were supposed to be all about.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	But then WHY did obummer ask, within the last month, for ANOTHER $50 BILLION STIMULUS expressly for infrastructure repairs?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	And $30 billion for teachers, and $26 billion for unemployment benefits to extend to 123 WEEKS!
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	Add those amount in on the cost of jobs and it becomes much more than $210,400.00 per job.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	As a matter of fact, I do.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Would you prefer the government had used the money instead to directly hire people?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Or perhaps a direct subsidy to everyone?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Oh wait, wouldn't that be *gasp* socialism?Of course a more efficient stimulus would be preferable, but unless you have a suggestion on how to actually do that, I really don't see your point.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	The stimulus was obviously far from perfect, and constructive criticism is always welcome.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	But it was necessary, and suggesting that we shouldn't have done it is unreasonable, unless you seriously are saying that a depression with 25% unemployment would be preferable to the current situation.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Sources please?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	That's quite a claim you're making, I'd like to see something to substantiate it.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Even if it's true, it's rather beside the point.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	The NO levees are simply a symptom of a much larger problem.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Arguing that if LA is corrupt and therefore does not spend its infrastructure money effectively we should not be spending money on infrastructure is rather akin to arguing that if the Chicago fire department is corrupt and ineffective, we should stop spending money on fire protection period.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Well, for one thing, because because the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that $1.6 trillion is needed over a five-year period to bring the nation's infrastructure to a good condition.http://apps.asce.org/reportcard/2005/index.cfmLike I said, the US has been neglecting its infrastructure for four decades.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	A large portion of our current infrastructure, especially the interstate system, was built in the 50's and 60's, with a design life of around 50 years.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	You do the math.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	The stimulus spending, even with another $50 billion added on, is just a drop in the bucket of what we really need.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	An unpleasant reality, but unless you think that you not having to pay taxes is more important then little things like functional transportation, water, electricity, and sewage systems...Yes, spending money on teachers is obviously a massive waste!
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Who needs schools?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	The education our kids will get on the streets should be more then enough to keep the US competitive for decades to come, right?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	And unemployment?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Ha, if someone's out of work, it's obviously their own fault, and we should let their lazy asses starve!
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Right?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Right??We need to deal with the situation as it really is, and ignoring problems because you think they shouldn't exist is both irresponsible and irrational.Oh, and incidentally - considering that Tea Party backed candidates have been winning some and losing some in Republican primaries, and considering that party primaries are notoriously more partisan and farther from the center then the nation as a whole, I really think that claiming the Tea Party represents the overwhelming majority of the nation is a bit of an overstatement.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	I'd prefer the Govt stay out of the &quot;FREE&quot; Market.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	There is not one shred of PROOF that your statement is true.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Is it one possibility?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Yes, it is ONE of the possibilities.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Just as the economy is a living thing, it also could have recovered on its own.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	That is not saying it would have, just saying that is also one of the possibilities.$814,000,000,000.00 that we did not and do not have.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Every cent of it could have gone to tax relief.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	An immediate $814 BILLION in the hands of the people might have really STIMULATED the economy.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	That is NOT an alternative suggestion.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Its just one of the many possibilities.The Govt interfering in business was a major factor in the down economy.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Relying on the same people to fix the problem they caused is hardly the wisest move.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	And before you start with the Bush blaming, I mean politicians of both parties over decades of inexperienced and enlightened interference in business.What the politicians did over time was to change the business heads from can do leaders and fierce competitors, into business politicians in order to get along with the Govt.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	And like ALL politicians everywhere, the business politicians went bad same as the elected politicians do.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	If you want to substantiate it, do a tiny bit of research on your own and then you'll know.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	What you are UNaware of is not my problem.And if I wish to say something, I SAY IT.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	And nowhere did I say that the levees should not be funded.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Saying the money got eaten up by corruption, which it did, is not saying the work shouldn't be done.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Federal highways and bridges, and Interstate Highways and bridges, are the responsibilities of the Federal Govt.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	All the other infrastructure is the responsibility of the state where the road or bridge is located.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Paying teachers is also the responsibility of the state in question.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Dealing with reality was what I was telling you in regard to the NO levees.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Living in an unreal dreamworld is what is irresponsible and irrational.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	And looking to a &quot;Big Brother&quot; Govt for answers is irresponsible and irrational.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	We will see, won't we?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	And it is tea party, not Tea Party.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	It is many diverse groups, not a political Party.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	And it is the majority of America as we will see.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Sadly, Dan40, not every solution produced by the free market is ideal.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	For example, the it gave us cities with burning rivers, sucg as the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, which caught fire at least 13 times.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	It also gave us cars that were frankly rolling death traps.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	The federal government had to drag the auto industry kicking and screaming into even putting in seat belts.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	And then there were continent spanning monopolies that used ruthless business practices to crush any potential competition, such as Standard Oil.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Child labor, downright deadly working conditions, slums and poverty, I could go on for quite a while.The point is that the free market is a very powerful and efficient engine for creating material wealth, but that's *all* it does.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Both the government and the market are tools for creating a prosperous society and dealing with that society's problems.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Like all tools, each has their strengths and weaknesses, and when used appropriately compliment each other.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Historical experience has shown that neither a pure laissez-faire capitalism nor a strict command economy work particularly well in the real world.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	We need a system of checks and balances, where different institutions work toward their strengths, and keep an eye on each other.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	I've been doing my best to research and reference my posts, if there's something I need to further substantiate, I apologize and ask that you please specify exactly which statement you mean.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	This is my basic argument:1 - Around the time of 2008, the US economy was on the verge of a major collapse, and faced the very real possibility of a second Great Depression.2 - Since then, the economy has moved back from the brink and improved substantially, even though the current economic situation is still far from good.3 - The first Great Depression created 25% unemployment, thousands of bank failures, and extensive homelessness in the US.I didn't think any of those was in dispute.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	If you take issue with them, please say so and I will track down some sources for you.4 - The Stimulus Bill has had a substantial impact on the economy, stimulating both GDP and employment.I have already provided extensive substantiation for this statement - if you need your memory refreshed, then just scroll up to my previous posts.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	If you still disagree with me on this point, then you either need to challenge my sources, provide sources of your own to contradict my position, or challenge some aspect of my reasoning.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Simply saying that there's no &quot;PROOF&quot; is not an argument - there's no such thing as absolute proof of anything, simply evidence in support of or against a position.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	I've provided the evidence in support of my position - it's now your responsibility to provide evidence in support of yours.5 - The conclusion to be drawn is that we were in serious danger of seeing 25% unemployment, and that the stimulus helped avert this.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Therefore, saying that the stimulus should not have been passed is implying that you find running the serious risk of 25% unemployment to be preferable to the current situation with 10% unemployment.This is simple and basic logic.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	If you find fault with it, where, exactly?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	I have never stated that 25% unemployment was certain.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	But the future never is certain.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	So again I ask, do you think risking such a drastic collapse and massive human suffering is preferable to what we have?If you're saying that pure tax cuts are much more effective at stimulating the economy then anything else, then, you know, actually make an argument for that.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Most economist say that tax cuts are one of several effective ways of stimulating the economy.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	For example, in the industry survey of economists I cited above, &quot;Panelists were asked to consider nine of the elements of the stimulus package and rank their effectiveness.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	The three ranked as most effective were infrastructure of a physical nature (roads, bridges, etc), unemployment benefits expansion, and personal tax-rate cuts.&quot;http://www.nabe.com/graphweek/2009/gw090329.htmlAs a final note, I would point out that when speaking of the Stimulus Bill as it was passed, you tend to say things such as &quot;$814,000,000,000.00 that we did not and do not have.&quot; And yet you seemed to imply that you would have supported the exact same expenditure if it had all gone to tax cuts.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Perhaps I am misunderstanding you, but it sounds very much as if you're implying that spending the money is fine, so long as you get a big piece of it.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	On what basis do you assert that government interference led to the recession?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	I've heard lots of theories about the causes, although most people seem to agree that the collapse of the housing bubble and the failure to regulate the derivatives market are major factors.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	What government interference are you talking about?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	How exactly did it cause the recession?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Explain, please.Saying that politics has somehow infected business in the last few decades is frankly absurd - business and politics have gone arm in arm for time immemorial.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Eve back in the Roman Republic campaigns ran on money as much as modern ones do.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Err, if you want to make a statement, then it's your responsibility to back it up, not mine.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	I'm very curious where you got the &quot;Less then 10% of the money reaching the levees&quot; figure.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	If you need help doing the research, PM me and I'll be happy to teach you.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	And I have to tell you, refusing to back up your statements makes it sound like you're just making it up.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Soooooo, it's a terrible thing for the federal government to do this, but if the state governments do the exact same thing, it's perfectly okay?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	O_o I'm sorry, but I really don't follow your reasoning there.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	What difference does it make if it's the feds or the states?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Ultimately it's all being paid for by tax dollars anyway.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	The federal government has much greater financial resources then any of the states, and many of the states are legally or constitutionally unable to borrow money, even in an emergency.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	It only makes sense for the level of government with the deepest pockets to do the heavy lifting during hard times.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	If you have a plan for fighting corruption and inefficiency, please, share!
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	We need all the good ideas we can get on the subject.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	And I'm simply pointing out that it at least sounds as if your general solution to problems is to ignore them.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	If you have constructive solutions to offer, I'd very much like to hear more about them.As for &quot;Big Brother&quot;...
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Have you actually read 1984?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	I really don't see how there's a comparison between a government that builds roads and bridges, pays teachers, and provides unemployment insurance and a government that has video surveillance in every citizen's home, requires everyone to participate in a &quot;Daily Hate,&quot; and uses physical and psychological torture to brainwash all dissenters into believing that the government is literally omnipotent.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	You seem to love to credit or blame me for saying things I did not say.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Your liberal prejudice prevents you from reading what was written, rather you decide what you think I said.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Which makes it impossible for me to carry on an intelligent debate with you when I say things clearly and you decide I'm saying something other than that.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	So enjoy your liberal nonsense dreamland.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	If you ever bump into reality, come back and talk to me.I cannot defend what you wish I said since I did not say what you wish I said.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	And you list a litany of bad things the free market has done, but you list none of the good things it has done.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	And seat belts were not mandated by the Govt until cars already had them.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	WEARING seat belts was mandated, not installing them.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Same with padded dashes, and collapsible steering wheels and crush zones.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	All installed in cars by AUTO men while politicians were chasing hookers on European junkets.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	When real auto men got replaced by political savvy executives, more safety was mandated in cars, and the American auto industry went down the toilet.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Gas guzzlers were the order of the day, WHY?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Because it was what SOLD!
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Then until the economy went to hell it was the yuppie SUV's that sold.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Amazing how tree huggers can ignore themselves driving about in a 4 ton Suburban Assault Vehicle and blame others for damaging Ma Nature.The free market has done some bad, no two ways about that.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	But it also INVENTED the 'middle class,' The free market came up with the 40 hour week, NOT unions.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Did you know that?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	And the 8 hour day, also not a union idea.Would you care to compare all the bad things that Govt has done, with all the bad the free market has done.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Or do you live on a street called ONE WAY?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Govt IS and has been, a much, much bigger problem[with no good answers] compared to the free market.And you list 1 2 3 4 5 like they were facts.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	They are NOT facts, they are liberal opinions.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Look up the difference.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	But you will read this like I said they are wrong.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	They are opinions, neither right or wrong, but not facts.
BigBob	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1734	Yes, I will vote in 2012, but not for my party I have been with since 18 years old!

TheTaoOfBill	KGB agent	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1737	And I refuse to vote for Putin!
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	&lt;&lt;&lt; Mod Edit: Flamebaiting &gt;&gt;&gt;You say the Stimulus spending SAVED the economy.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	THAT is an opinion, not a fact.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	When I say that economies have recovered on their own.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	That IS a fact.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	But it is not saying that this present economy would have recovered on its own.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	We DO NOT know either way, that is a fact.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	My OPINION, and always stated as such, is that the Stimulus was and is a waste of money.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	When I said that IF 3.5 million jobs were created, [and my opinion is that they were not and will not be] then those jobs cost $232,000.00 each.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	Somehow you believe its OK for the Govt to &quot;create jobs&quot; at a cost of $232,000.00 Each, and also OK for the Govt to increase taxes on all those who are &quot;rich.&quot; Meaning they make over $200,000.00.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	So its OK for the Govt to 'create' jobs that cost $32,000.00 MORE than the &quot;rich line?&quot;When I said the Govt could just as well given the whole Stimulus money to the unemployed, I clearly said that is NOT an alternative suggestion.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	Yet your prejudicial interpretation blinded you to that and attempted to ridicule me for making such a suggestion.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	Which I did not make.So since you are unable to see or hear, or read, REALITY, and I am unable to wander in your Utopian dreamworld because reality keeps biting me on the ass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Forget it.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1741	Given the fact the economy was tanking at -7% and losing 700,000 jobs a month when the stimulus was passed and its now growing and the private sector is creating jobs, given that the bi-partisan CBO estimates that millions of jobs have been saved or created by the stimulus, it is an opinion that is well supported by fact.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1742	You statement is ALSO an opinion.And the CBO is NOT bi-partisan, unless you consider it speaking FOR the party in power to be bi-partisan.And the CBO was correct last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WHEN??They make 10 year projections.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1742	Kindly name a CBO projection of 10 or more years vintage that is correct.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1743	Supported by facts.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1743	Sure it is. It's not controlled by the party in power
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1743	You confuse projections versus reporting past events.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1744	This passes for originality in the liberal world.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1745	Just about as much as the post to which it responded.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	NET: you cannot name an accurate projection of the CBO.You may use ALL CBO projections since its inception.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	Is there a single one that proved accurate?And since there IS NOT, why should any citizen pay any attention to CBO projections.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	We know one thing about their projections from experience, IT WILL BE WRONG.The party in power GIVES the CBO the parameters they want the CBO to consider.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	The CBO simply projects on what it is given.The party in power gives the CBO a program that the party estimates will cost a trillion over 10 years.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	They tell the CBO that they will raise taxes in 8 years to get the needed trillion in funding.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	The CBO 'projects' the program to be deficit neutral.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	You know, I know, the CBO knows, dust mites in the Congressional carpet know, that no such tax increase will be passed.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	But that is not the CBO's job, the parameters say the program will be funded so the CBO projects deficit neutral.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	A silly sleight of hand by whichever party is in power.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1747	No one is talking about projections.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1747	Why are you?
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1747	Proof that CBO estimates of job creation are based on parameters given to it by the Democrats, please.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	Talk about seeing the world through rose colored glasses.Once again you present OPINIONS AS FACTS.FACT [fækt]n1.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	a truth verifiable from experience or observation.O-PIN-ION (-pnyn)n.1.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	A belief or conclusion held with confidence but not substantiated by positive knowledge or proof:The ny times link is useless, they are an advertising agency for liberals AND they are rapidly going out of business for their stupid choice of yellow journalism.The NABE link is clearly an opinion, no FACTS in evidence.But amazingly, their OPINION is that there is a 10.3% CHANCE that the Stimulus shortened the recession.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	A 60.3% CHANCE that the Stimulus had a &quot;modest effect&quot; on shortening the recession.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	And a 29.4% CHANCE that the Stimulus had little or NO effect.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	Are you sure that's the info you wish to use to justify an expenditure of nearly a trillion dollars that we don't have?hint: CHANCE does not translate into FACT.And the link to Ben Stein's opinion.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	Did you even read it?He wrote that 3/19/10.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	Does not voice any strong support for the Stimulus then, nor strong opposition to it either.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	In any case, again, it is a opinion not a fact.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	A fact is that the economy is in almost exactly the same place today as it was on 3/19/10.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	7 months later and improvements to the economy are infinitesimally small.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	And just as good a case can be made for the Stimulus slowing the recovery as can be made for speeding it up.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	As can a case be made for NATURAL recovery taking place on its own.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	As YOUR links bear out!Obummer couldn't look up respect on Google let alone deserve ANY!
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	I'll elaborate if you're confused about my opinion.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	He IS a closed minded Socialist completely lost in academic theories with no clue of practicality.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	But that is my considered and very experienced OPINION.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	Yeeeees, Dan, I am well aware of the difference between opinions and facts.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	I also know that facts always come with some degree of doubt and uncertainty.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	And opinions aren't all created equal, and don't exist in a vacuum.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	There *are* no certainties in life, no absolutes.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	We need to weigh all the evidence in any particular case and decide what the best conclusion is based on the information available to us.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	I present the evidence as I find it, and invite everyone to reach their own conclusions and present their own arguments.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	I don't change the evidence to suit my point of view, and I don't cherry pick.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	I change my point of view to suit the evidence.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	If you want to convince me, then show me. Show me the facts, show me your argument.I'm getting a little tired of people who say that any news source that ever presents anything they disagree with is a mouthpiece for the other side.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	And yes, there are plenty of liberals guilty of this as well.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	Any news source that doesn't challenge you and make you question your positions at least from time to time isn't a very good news source.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	In any case, in this instance, the NY Times is simply reporting on research done by Moody's et al. If you want to discount the information, it's the originator, not the reporter, you need to address.As for the NABE survey, yes you're right, it is a matter of opinion.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	The opinions of a a large number of professional economists, who study this stuff for a living.And yes, I did read Ben Stein's article.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	As I stated when I originally posted the link, the point is not that Mr Stein is giving an enthusiastic endorsement of the stimulus - clearly he is not - the point is that a very conservative economist of high standing like Mr Stein, who has criticized the stimulus on many occasions, would seem to imply that stimulus was both necessary and at least somewhat effective.&quot;But the losses to the economy following the failure of Lehman have been on the order of hundreds of billions, maybe trillions.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	Certainly the rescue and stimulus packages needed in the wake of the Lehman failure have amounted to the trillions.&quot;And if just as good a case can be made that the stimulus slowed down the recovery, then make it already.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	I must admit that I am rather puzzled by your insistence that the stimulus has hurt the economy in the face of evidence to the contrary.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	If you have evidence that supports your position, why haven't you shown us?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	And if you don't, why do you hold so steadfastly to it?And as I pointed out before, 37% of the stimulus bill was tax breaks.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	If it didn't help the economy, that implies that tax cuts don't help the economy.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1751	If you wish, you may add an additional 10,000 words, or a million more words.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1751	But an opinion will still be an opinion.You said 37% of the Stimulus was tax breaks.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1751	I have an opinion on that.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1751	The full amount of the Stimulus is now admitted to be $814 Billion.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1751	37% of that is $301,180,000,000.00.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1751	My opinion is that you should recheck your claim.
jthorp24	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1752	There I fixed it for you.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	Calling my position an opinion (which it is) does not make it any less well founded or grounded in facts.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	You seem to think that if you call something an opinion, that means it's arbitrary, and you can just as legitimately take any position on the matter.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	That may be true if you're debating whether chili or stir fry is tastier.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	It's not if you're debating if the Earth is flat or round.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	And it's not when we're debating whether or not the stimulus bill helped the economy.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	Stop trying to hide behind flimsy rhetorical devices, and either show us your evidence or admit you don't have any.As for the exact numbers...
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	[shrug] the nominal costs and revenues related to any legislation is **always** an estimate.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	The actual numbers can't be determined until well after the legislation has run its course - for *any* bill.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	And there will always be differences between the estimate and the actual number, that's why it's called an estimate.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	Your point being?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1754	This is your exact quote:&quot;And as I pointed out before, 37% of the stimulus bill was tax breaks.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1754	If it didn't help the economy, that implies that tax cuts don't help the economy.&quot;Now my eyes are not what they once were, but I do not see the word estimate anywhere.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1754	But if you wish to retract and now call it an estimate, OK. And I will say that $301 billion in tax breaks is a wildly insane estimate.Now can a statement be an opinion and also be true?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1754	Yes of course an opinion can prove true.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1754	EQUALLY true for both my opinions and yours.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1756	The stimulus bill, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, is meant to create jobs and boost the economy.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1756	It cost $787 billion, including $499 billion to fund new roads, hire teachers and generally keep people employed, and about $288 billion in tax breaks to individuals and businesses.

Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1756	Tax cuts were 37% of the stimulus bill.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1756	It's lower if you count additional stimulus monies added since then.

Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	Do you not independently try to find out the TRUTH for yourselves?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	Why do I listen to both FOX and MSNBC?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	Because I want to hear both sides and decide who is lying MORE.Here are some sources for you to peruse.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	NONE of them right leaning or tea party connected:http://washingtonindependent.com/wp-...10/08/cfrb.pngfrom Bloomberg:Aug. 20 (Bloomberg) -- The Congressional Budget Office lowered its estimate for the cost of the Obama administration&#8217;s economic stimulus package to $814 billion from $862 billion.The CBO adjusted the estimate because it &#8220;revised its economic and technical assumptions,&#8221; the agency said in a report issued yesterday.This from the Washington Post, a definite liberal publication:The CBO cautioned that the the act's effects are expected to &quot;gradually diminish during the second half of 2010 and beyond,&quot; leaving the private sector to pick up the slack in an economy that is already showing signs of deteriorating rapidly.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	On the bright side,[ now THAT's FUNNY] the CBO revised the cost of the package downward: Originally estimated to cost $787 billion over 10 years, the stimulus was later estimated to cost $862 billion.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	But in the report released Tuesday, the CBO said it now expects the measure to cost only about $814 billion through 2019, with 70 percent of those costs incurred by the end of this year.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	This from the CBO itself: You will find the CBO&quot;S revised estimate of the ARRA Act &quot;Stimulus Bill&quot; on page 9.They estimate the bill to cost $787 billion at passage, revised the cost upward to $862 billion a few months later and have now settled on the lower estimate of $814.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	billion.Do you want more proof that you have no clue that your masters are lying to you?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	I could, if I wished, cite 20 to 50 more neutral sources.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	But you'd be better off doing some REAL RESEARCH, and learning on your own.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	Your misconceptions have become a bore.Would you please start learning what is really happening in our country or STFU.

Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	WRONG again.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	Misinterpreting an opinion as a fact.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	It says it is EXPECTED that the effects will be diminishing over time.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	That ASSUMES there was an effect, it does not prove ANYTHING.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	Is English NOT you native language?The report of the CBO neither proves there was or proves there was not an effect caused by the stimulus.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	Remember many many economic downturns have happened throughout our history.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	Some had some kind of Govt intervention, others had NO intervention whatsoever.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	ALL eventually recovered, NONE had a Stimulus Bill.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	The one with the most Govt intervention was the Depression.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	With massive and unrelenting Govt intervention, the depression lasted from the early 30's until the END OF WWII.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	Some help!When the Stimulus was passed, THAT DAY, I predicted that the recession just got extended by 2 years minimum.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	Now 21 months later, the economy is still all but FLAT.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	Was my prediction correct?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	Not yet, but we're getting there.And when this recession really does end, you may ABSOLUTELY count on unpleasant inflation.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	[Looks amused] So you're happy to quote the CBO when you feel it's supporting your position, but when I point out it's actually doing the opposite, it suddenly becomes an opinion?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	Yes, yes, I know you're just trying to turn my own liberal brainwashing propaganda against me, or some such.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	(Incidentally, that's sarcasm, and not intended as a serious representation of your position.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	And are the shouting and personal insults really necessary?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	They really don't strengthen your argument at all, you know.)And as I've already explained, there's no such thing as absolute proof, and any single piece of evidence certainly doesn't &quot;prove&quot; anything.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	But when multiple lines of evidence all point to the same thing, you can have a pretty good amount of confidence in that conclusion.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	And so far all the evidence is pointing to the Stimulus Bill having helped the economy.And yes, you are right that the economy will almost certainly completely recover on its own.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	But I don't think that's a reason to not use the tools at our disposal to help the situation.Some historical corrections: Obama's stimulus policy has been pretty much the same as that used by Presidents of both parties in every recession since the Great Depression.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	The details vary, but the overall strategy is the same - cut taxes, extend unemployment benefits, increase spending, do whatever's necessary to get money flowing again.The Great Depression is generally considered to have lasted from 1929 until the start of WWII, not the end.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	The Depression hit its lowest point in 1933, and after that began a slow but steady improvement.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	Economic conditions had improved a lot by 1937, when the conservative coalition convinced FDR that the economy had improved enough that it was time to return to a more normal policy.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	New Deal programs were rolled back, taxes increased, and spending cut to try to balance the federal budget.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	The result was a second crash, where industrial production fell almost 30% in a few months, and unemployment went from 14.3% in 1937 to 19.0% in 1938.And no, your prediction has proven to be wrong.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	Right now the economy is stagnant, not in recession.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	Things aren't good, but they're not getting worse.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	True, that makes little difference to the folks who are out of work, but the economy booming makes little difference to someone out of work.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	Just to clarify, flat = stagnant, going down = recession, going up = recovery.To sum up, as bad as things are now, all the evidence indicates that without the Stimulus Bill, things would be appreciably worse.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	As for the policies being advocated by the Republicans...
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	As far as I can tell, they are saying they want to cut taxes and balance the budget.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	Setting aside for the moment that in order to balance the budget, you'll realistically have to raise taxes *and* cut spending, those policies are an awful lot like the ones that Hoover followed at the beginning of the Depression, and that the conservatives coalition convinced FDR to try in 1937.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	Balancing the budget will be a short term hit to the economy - it always has been.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	REALITY is all the strength my arguments needs.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	And at no time and in no way have I attempted to use CBO statements as facts.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	Making that error is strictly your domain.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	Whether I agree with anything the CBO says or not, does not in any way assign factual credence to their opinions/projections.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	I ALWAYS know their reports are conjecture, not fact.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	When you agree with them, suddenly they are stating facts.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	That's silly.Unemployment remains at 9.6% for September.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	Essentially FLAT for all of 2010.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	Talk about your phantom 'recovery' to those people.Read the entire BLS report.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	Especially the part that says that those no longer counted as unemployed because they have stopped looking for a job is now 503,000 higher than September 2009, WHEN THAT FIGURE WAS 697,000.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	Its now 1,200,000.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	The Stimulus is serving them well, is it not?Perhaps I should point out that these are statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and are supposed to be facts, not opinions, since you seem to have great difficulty with the distinctions.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1769	Flat might not be much of a recovery.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1769	But it's not a recession either.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1769	In fact it's leaning more towards recovery than recession because we are growing.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1769	We're just not growing at a fast enough rate.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1770	And what proof do liberals have that our very slow, almost non-existent &quot;recovery&quot; in not caused by natural recovery as HAS happened many times in the past.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1770	Is it Stimulus OR is it wounds healing on their own?
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1770	Neither you nor I can PROVE either premise to be true or false.oBum is first to point out that, &quot;IT'S NOT MY FAULT.&quot; No matter what the question.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1770	So maybe the recovery, what little there is of it, is not his &quot;fault,&quot; either.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	No proof is needed.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	It's a basic understanding the stimulus spending increases consumer demand and thus results in shorter recession.Yes the economy theoretically could have recovered on it's own.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	But there is no way that after a financial collapse and a collapse of the 3 largest job produces, the auto companies, we would have been out of the recession less than 2 years after it started.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	It is just economically impossible for the recession to end in less than 2 years without government assistance.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	In no previous example where we've had a complete financial failure and a major industry failure at the same time and it has recovered on it's own in less than 2 years.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	That just doesn't happen.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	It's not possible to do.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	Government intervention ended the recession faster and thus saved us money.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	I don't know why you are so against saving money.
SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1772	And fires will go out on their own also.
SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1772	But we usually think its best douse them with water to reduce the overall damage.I predicted 2 years ago that if the Economy recovered, Conservatives would say it would have done so faster without the stimulas.If the Obama Administration hadn't pushed the stimulas plan and the economy was 4 times worse than it is now, the few of us still with jobs would be blaming his administration.I do know that 2 years ago, my 401k was half the size it is now, people were wondering whether GM would survive the year, whether the entire banking industry would go under, and how far housing prices would tumble.
SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1772	There was panic in the air.Now there is no more panic.
SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1772	The banking industry is stable, GM is working, housing prices have largely stabilized and industry is picking up- slowly.
SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1772	Perfect?
SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1772	No. But this recession was years in the making, and its recovery will not happen overnight.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	So we should have squirted water on the economy?
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Or throw money at forest fires?
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Or can we make arguments that are not pure nonsense.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	YES, water on fires.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	NO the economy is not a fire.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	And I predicted that the economy would take longer to recover due to Govt INTERFERENCE.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Well the economy HAS NOT recovered.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	So much for your 'prediction.'
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	The majority of us with open minds ARE blaming his &quot;administration.&quot; You, and he, should have noticed that but so far you haven't.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Nov.3 might be a wake up call.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	I have a number of investments that are still below their peak, well below.And GM did not survive.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	GM went bankrupt and was WRONGLY bailed out by the Govt.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	GM paid back the bailout money from the $50 billion in stock that the taxpayers bought without agreeing to buy.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	That stock is today worth 75 CENTS a share.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	There is a plan to reissue &quot;real&quot; GM stock in an IPO soon.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	If that IPO does not generate high participation and prices.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	We, the taxpayers, stand to lose most or substantial parts of that $50 Billion.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	I DO have to agree with you about PANIC.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	But it was panic by politicians of both parties, led by Democrats.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Democrats passed both the TARP and the Stimulus.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	The TARP had Republican help.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	The Stimulus was a purely Democrat panic.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	And panic was what they both were and are.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	TARP was $700 Billion to purchase or insure sub prime bundled non-secure &quot;securities.&quot; Odd since Fannie &amp; Freddie insured those &quot;securities&quot; even before the bubble burst.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	We didn't buy the securities, we lent the money to the banks.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Why was it panic by the politicians?
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	We only put out about half the $700 Billion.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	That shows the knee jerk panic.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	And we will lose just under $100 Billion on the deal when its all said and done.The Stimulus panic, pretty much the same.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Much was to go to 'shovel ready' projects.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	It went to bailing out Democrat states debts.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	It has been added to numerous times and now totals over a Trillion Dollars.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Much remains unspent.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Could the Stimulus be responsible for any private sector jobs?
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Yes, the Stimulus &quot;COULD&quot; be responsible for a number of private sector jobs.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Is there any actual proof that the Stimulus is responsible for even one private sector job?
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	NO.What we do have is the FACT that we are now in the slowest recovery since the Great Depression.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Not a very Stimulating Stimulus, is it?
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	I again agree, this recession was many DECADES in the making and wholly the fault of bad legislation passed by both Republicans and Democrats over many years.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	So YES the recovery will take a long time.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Expecting those who caused it [politicians] to fix it is just stupid.
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1774	We are not growing.
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1774	Take off the glasses.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1776	So we pass $700 Billion in TARP and over $1 Trillion in Stimulus to get a &quot;LEAN.&quot; The LIEN we got is AGAINST the countries future.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1777	You're (*)(*)(*)(*) (*)(*)(*)(*)ing straight we did!
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1777	And we saved trillions doing it!
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1777	Do you know how much a long drawn out recession costs this country!?
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1777	Why are you so against saving money!
Sassy	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1778	All the Boehner Republicans promise is more of NeoCon Bratboy/Cheney egotistic, military saber rattling in the name of &quot;the WAR on terror!&quot; when Iraq was a simplistic power grab to corner and dominate the oil market fueled by a economic policy of greed that redistributed the wealth earned by stealing jobs from the working class middle American to feed the gluttony of the of the top 2% Republican oligarchy striving to turn the world into their own version of the United Business Nations; and the deluded tea party Republicans who wrap themselves in the stars and stripes, carry guns to rallies to convince themselves they are in tune with the American Constitution they not only don't understand but probably have never read.
Sassy	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1778	It is obvious from the home made signs at their hate filled rallies that they get their Constitution &quot;education&quot; from a Mr. MaGoo-like, Glenn Beck, the cry baby synthetic Mormon whose shriveled brain is fried from alcohol and drug abuse, much like his mentor and collaborator, Rush Limbaugh.
Sassy	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1778	These guys are so charismatic and appealing they turn &quot;red-necks&quot; and &quot;bimbos&quot; into the elite.Republicans haven't a clue or produced one as to how to get this country out of a &quot;depression/recession&quot; other than to bombastically whine about and with shrill, moronic complaints about how &quot;slow&quot; the Democrats are at it.
Sassy	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1778	In point of fact, all Republicans know how to do is to drive the country into a recession (Hoover, Reagan/Bush and now Bratboy).

TheTaoOfBill	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1780	But she did claim that Alaska's proximity to Russia gives her foreign policy experience.

TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	And she left it in massive amounts of debt.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	Yeah.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	And she couldn't take the pressure of the job and quit.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	Her sudden resignation cost the state hundreds of thousands.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	Her experience includes being a failed mayor and a quitter governor.

TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	Actually he was incharge of a large staff when he was community organizer and he was the president of the Harvard Law Review.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	Those are two executive position.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	And regardless he is now president of the united states.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	He now has more executive experience in his pinky than Palin has in her entire failure of a career.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	He ended the recession in 200 days.

Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1783	Quietly they revise their earlier OVERSTATEMENTS downward.

Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1783	And I consider both the CBO and the BLS to be liberal biased sources.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1784	Even the Wall Street Journal...a conservative leaning business news report...
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1784	Says the recession ended in 2009.

TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1784	Ever since Obama's stimulus passed the economy has been growing.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1784	Obama's quick action saved the economy.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1785	Another liberal that reads through rose colored glasses.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1785	WSJ did not determine the recession was over, they simply repeated a conclusion reached by:&quot;National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee, a group of academic economists &quot;Copied from the WSJ article.So your actual originating source is a group of liberal academics.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1785	Their OPINIONS are not facts.

TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1786	The truth has a liberal bias.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1786	Get used to it.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1786	Ignoring the truth does not make it untrue.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1786	Every respectable source, conservative or liberal leaning, says this recession ended in June 2009.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1786	It ended by the textbook definition of what a recession is. A shrinking economy.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1786	You can't have a recession when we have had multiple quarters in a row of economic growth.
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1787	What growth are you speaking of?
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1787	Unemployment rate is pretty much stagnant.
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1787	The debt is increasing.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1788	Growth as in the definition of Economic Growth.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1788	The GDPUnemployment is a lagging indicator.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1788	In other words unemployment stays high long after a recession has ended.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1788	And the debt increases in prosperity periods as well.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1789	So you are an advocate of borrowing and spending one's way out of debt.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1789	Good luck with that.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1789	There is a Hurricane named INFLATION heading for your wallet.Here is an interesting graph from the same Govt Agency that calculates the GDP.http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/GovView.asp.Please note the widening gap between income and expenditures of the US Govt.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1789	The gap noticeably widens with the installation of the Democrat controlled Congress in Jan 2007 and widens much more under the reckless spending of obummer.Yes BUSH spent way too much too.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1789	But this shows that against income he was a miser compared to &quot;Riverboat Barak.&quot;It also cracks me up that liberals wish to blame Bush for the expenditures through 9/30/2009, the end of the last Bush fiscal year.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1789	But want to credit obummer for all the imagined 'good' that happened between Jan 20 09 and 9/30/09.

TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1795	I advocate low taxes high spending in recessions.

TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1795	And when demand starts to pick up again then all it will take is for the fed to raise interest rates to keep inflation under control.

TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1795	The very clear problem is the sudden drop in revenue.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1795	Democrats are experts at raising the revenue of the country.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1795	Because democrats know how to pay the bills.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1795	GWB on the other hand decided that he should give the rich huge tax cuts.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1795	And thus our revenue plummeted and we lost hundreds of billions of dollars.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1795	That graph proves the sudden drop in revenue is what caused the spike in the deficit.

Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1800	Now, Congress must ensure that old flame isn't rekindled.A new Government Accountability Office report nonsensically concludes that the funding ban doesn't apply to Affordable Housing Centers of America (AHCOA), formerly ACORN Housing Corp., which occupies ACORN's former Philadelphia offices.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1800	This, despite GAO previously saying ACORN Housing received about 1 million taxpayer dollars -- and Housing and Urban Development's inspector general urging &quot;inactive status&quot; for AHCOA until questions about its handling of previous federal grants are settled.U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., wants Congress to &quot;legislatively clarify that AHCOA should not receive any federal funding.&quot;ACORN's Washington sweethearts must think taxpayers -- and lawmakers -- have awfully short memories.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1800	Hopefully, enough remember ACORN scandals to deny federal funding to its renamed affiliates.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	LOL Dan, you really have little room to talk about liberals being bothered by the truth, considering your tendency to completely ignore anything that doesn't support your position.My opinion is that Fox isn't really a news network, it's a political opinion and commentary network.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	Which is, of course, perfectly fine, but it's really better not to mix the two up.You should *never* get your information from just one source, no matter how trusted.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	Even the best of us make mistakes from time to time.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	I think the best strategy is to use several centrists sources.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	The sources on both extremes seem to have little compunction about distorting information, or even out right lying.As for Mr Beck...
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	I've listened to his radio show once.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	(This does also mean I'm not really in a good position to make an assessment of him overall.)
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	And in that program, I heard him make one statement in particular that... well, I don't know if it was a deliberate lie or just blazing stupidity.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	He was complaining about an American history textbook he had recently come across.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	He made several points about the book, and some seemed well founded to me, but he then went on to site a passage in the book which said something about the US's founding fathers &quot;furthering&quot; the ideals of democracy.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	He denounced the use of the word &quot;furthering&quot; with incredulity repeatedly, leaving the impression that the US invented democracy.I don't know what Mr Beck's thinking behind such a statement was, but it was certainly bizarre, and left an extremely poor impression with me.
jthorp24	losttexan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1804	Can't be serious...
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1805	Obama is a good man who's policies are saving America.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1805	What's not to love...?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	Once again you present your opinions as factual and berate me for stating my opinion.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	IF you were fully aware of all my posts in re: media sources, you would know that I have never heard even a second of Beck's radio show and have never watched his TV show from start to finish.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	You would also know that I read liberal papers and watch liberal &quot;news&quot; sources, including Keith and Chris.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	Each are so radical they make Beck seem like a shy lamb.I listen to both sides, research what each side has to say, double check the research sources for their agendas, and weigh it all against my 7 decades of experience in life and starting and running multi-million dollar businesses.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	What I have stated is that FOX IS right leaning but is the most fair network on the air.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	They more than ANY other news source present BOTH sides of an issue.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	They REGULARLY have on very far left liberals to present the liberal view.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	And they do not demonize the liberal view, nor marginalize it as liberals constantly do to the conservative views.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	FOX does not have, nor does it care to have any words to use against liberals like &quot;teabaggers.&quot;I present here MY opinions, not FOX's opinions.And I'll stack my opinions up against yours using NEUTRAL sources at any time.Here is something that is a fact.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	FOX is outselling every one of the liberal slanted news sources.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	FOX is making money while NBC et al. is loosing viewers and the NYTimes and others are looking at bankruptcy.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	Liberals and Democrats attribute that to the public being stupid.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	Well my OPINION is that the public is actually very smart and the public has seen through the liberal nonsense.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	The upcoming elections are the proof.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	The Republican and 'teabagger' challengers are running on the issues of too big Govt and too much spending.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	While the Democrats are begging the free ride parasites to get out and vote for Dems or lose their free ride on people that actually have ambitions and goals,.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1807	You know there are sources of information that are neither liberal or conservative.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1807	But in general I've seen you label those sources as liberally biased simply because they go against your world view and ideology.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1809	I do not accept NOR USE biased sources.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1809	Since I do not use conservative sources against liberals, I do not accept liberal sources against conservatives.Your opinion of an unbiased source is one that is not radically far left.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1809	My opinion is one that is as neutral as possible in either direction.When I cite a source like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and get a rebuttal from a liberal using a source like MoveOn.org.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1809	I laugh at the tragicomic stupidity of that liberal.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1809	Both for attempting to use that source and for believing any words on that site.
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1810	What policies are SAVING America?
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1810	America is built on freedom and capitalism.
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1810	He is CHANGING America.
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1810	Turning America into a socialist country is hardly saving America...
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1810	It's destroying it.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	You know, Dan, this constant harping on fact and opinion is really starting to irritate me. You seem to think that you can label my positions as opinions, that all opinions are equally valid, and that therefore your position cannot be refuted.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	That's a load of BS, and frankly, I'm insulted that you'd try to hide behind such a transparent rationalization.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	In the real world, the line between opinion and fact is not as absolute as you like to imply.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	There is *always* some uncertainty in *any* information, and ultimately *anything* can be characterized as an opinion.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	The law of gravity is an opinion, since you have to take as accurate the information supporting it.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	The same with the germ theory of disease.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	Or the idea that the Earth is a giant sphere floating in space.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	It's an opinion that you can see the upper portions of an approaching ship at sea first because of the curvature of the earth.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	It's an opinion that all the photographs of the Earth from space aren't faked.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	It's an opinion that GPS uses satellites, and not some mechanism that's kept secret to conceal that the Earth is actually flat.So unless you want to join the tinfoil beanie crowd, quit trying to pretend that all opinions are equal.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	They aren't, and it's inane, insulting, and just plain childish to keep saying they are.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	And frankly, if the only way you can challenge my positions is by trying to use an underhanded yet pathetically transparent rhetorical trick, you're as much as admitting that I'm right.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	Just to pick one insanely DUMB thing out of the Health Insurance Bill.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	Deficit neutral??????????
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	Since passage the CBO has revised the costs UPWARD a few times already and we are at the barest beginning.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	It will cost, according to the CBO just about a TRILLION dollars.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	That will be paid for in mandated coverage[being challenged in 20 lawsuits now with more to come], increased taxes, and by taking $500,000,000,000.00 out of Medicare.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	So HALF the funding of obamacare is to come from the insurance coverage that covers the people that will need it the most.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	Where is the logic in that?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	Plus we are talking about over 50 million Seniors, and those Seniors VOTE.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	obamacare does not specify where and how HALF A TRILLION dollars will be taken from Medicare, But I'm willing to bet that no politician seeking another term EVER is going to vote to take away HEALTH CARE from 50+ million seniors that vote.I predict here and now that obamacare, if allowed to proceed, will incur a 10 year cost well in excess of $5,000,000,000,000.00 $5 Trillion dollars.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	And I further predict not not only will half a trillion dollars NOT come from Medicare, but the Medicare funding will INCREASE.50+ million voters will not be angered.That is only one aspect of obamacare.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	Another is increased coverage without underwriting is not possible without large premium increases and liberal politicians are well aware of that FACT, not opinion.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	They are planning to do a &quot;correction&quot; sometime in the future that will screw the country royally, or they are more stupid than we can believe.HOW is it that insurance companies have been regulated by politicians for all of your life and before, yet they are screwing the public.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	And how is insurance companies being regulated under obamacare going to be any different.Before obamacareInsurance companies could NOTCancel an in force policy except for non payment of premiums.Cancel a policy because someone got sick.Raise an individual's premium for any reason, sickness, age, whatever.These regulations existed before obamacare and were &quot;enforced&quot; by elected or appointed politicians.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	obamacare changes nothing in this area.And before you argue with me, look it all up on State Govt websites under Insurance Commissioners or Insurance Regulators.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1813	How about preventing a second Great Depression?
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1813	That doesn't qualify as saving the US?
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1813	And socialism does not exclude freedom *or* democracy.Actually, I'm curious, why exactly are we arguing about labels from a nineteenth century ideological debate?
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1813	Surely we've learned something about how to run an economy and a society in general in the last two centuries.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1813	Such as that neither a pure laissez-faire capitalist system nor a strict command economy work terribly well in the real world.
jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1814	We are in a depression, well I think everyone can at least agree that we are in a recession.
jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1814	What did he do to save it?
jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1814	It wasn't like he waved a wand of anything.
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1815	Who says we are in a depression?
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1815	Rush?
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1815	Sean?
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1816	The Great Depression in the US saw 25% unemployment, thousands of bank failures, and large numbers of Americans forced to live in shanty towns called Hoovervilles.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1816	You tell me, jthorpe, does that sound like what's going on today?
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1816	The economy right now is stagnant, not in recession.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1816	It's bad, but at least not getting worse.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1816	And certainly a lot better then it was two years ago.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1816	And no, President Obama didn't wave a wand - he got the stimulus passed.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1816	And as we've already examined in detail in this thread, the stimulus *did* help the economy, and things *would* have been worse without it.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1816	(Yes, Dan, we know you completely disagree with this, no need to repeat yourself.)
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	Sorry but I will not let you get away with stating an opinion as a fact.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	Your OPINION and obummer's opinion and his Harvard economists opinions are that 700,000 jobs, or 2 million jobs or 3.5 million jobs have been &quot;SAVED&quot; [an absolute bullsh!t term] or created since the Stimulus.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	None of those numbers are provable.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	When tried, even the liberal media stated that they were vastly overstated.But whatever number you wish to opine, fine.There is also a group of economists that believe that 2 million jobs have been LOST since the Stimulus was passed.Your opinion would disagree with their opinion.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	I actually do not have an opinion on which side is correct or most accurate.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	What I see with my own eyes is businesses closed up.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	Chain restaurants with multi-promotions and lower prices.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	Housing developments without a single occupied home.Reports of housing starts and sales still in the dumper with the lowest interest rates of my long, long lifetime.And there is not a light at the end of the tunnel in sight yet.I will say this.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	With all the talk about foreclosure paperwork problems, obama said he does not support a moratorium on foreclosures.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	That is the single wise economic statement he has made since taking office.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1818	Actually its the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office's estimate.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1818	Not Obama's or his team's.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	You don't have an opinion?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	Bull.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	You couldn't have made your opinion any clearer if you'd rented every billboard in Times Square.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	At least have the decency and courage to stand by your own position.So tell me, who exactly are these economists?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	Let's see some names, some quotes.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	If you're going to cite someone, actually cite them.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	Yes, it's an opinion that the Stimulus helped the economy.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	And I and others here have provided ample evidence to support it.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	You've even inadvertently provided supporting evidence yourself.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	And despite being challenged many times, you have yet to provide a single shred of evidence to the contrary.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	I really fail to see how any other conclusion can be reasonably reached or supported.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	Yeees, Dan, as *everyone* agrees, the economy sucks.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	No one says any different, the situation is bad.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	But it could be a heck of a lot worse.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	We're nowhere near the levels of misery seen in the Great Depression.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	The stimulus has helped.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	How bad would things be now if President Obama had done nothing, just sat back and watched?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	No one knows for certain, but I, for one, am glad we didn't have to find out the hard way.---------On a lighter note...I'm working on getting back to you about health care reform, but it's kind of annoying having to track down the insurance regulations of every state.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	[mutters] 50 different sets of regulations for one country, this is why the states rights people are mad.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	[j/k] LOL It *is* kind of a pain, tho.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	But I will get back to you on it.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	As ALWAYS you tell me what I meant!
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Get over yourself.I said I don't have an opinion on who is right on creating or losing jobs, because I do not have an opinion on who is right.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	I'm sure that any jobs created are not as numerous as the admin and its cronies claim, and I'm sure that the jobs lost figure is at least somewhat inflated by the admin's POLITICAL opponents.I have the opinion that the Stimulus was unnecessary and has extended the recovery by 2 years or more.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	And the only opinion I have about pro or con politicians, and jobs losses or gains, is that neither is overly concerned with the truth.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	And whom did you quote other than administration cronies?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Do you want me to quote ultra conservatives.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Or are you claiming that there are no ultra conservatives saying the Stimulus lost jobs?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Why name names when I do not put any faith in the accuracy of either side?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	And you already know, or should, that there are opponents with contrary opinions.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	You inability to see anything does not in any way change conjecture into fact.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	But you do LOVE to state your opinions as facts.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	---------Yes, it could be worse and yes it could be better.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	History may tell us which, since currents events only show what is happening with massive Govt intervention.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	And massive Govt intervention IS what caused the recession in the first place.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Relying on the same idiots[politicians, not just liberals] to fix the problems THEY caused is about as far from wisdom as we can get.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Just as Wall Street and the banking industry were HEAVILY REGULATED by politicians LONG BEFORE the financial &quot;crisis.&quot; So was the insurance industry even MORE heavily regulated long before, many decades, before obamacare.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Insurance companies were heavily regulated long before obama was even born.A few moments of clear thinking ought to make you say, &quot;Of course!&quot; &quot;How could they NOT have been regulated all these years.&quot; Besides simple logic, it is also FACT.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Each year, TRILLIONS of dollars pass through both Wall Street and insurance companies.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Do you think ANY politician, liberal, conservative, Democrat, Republican, Independent, Whig, or any other group would ever ignore any industry handling TRILLIONS of dollars?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	EVEN for a DAY?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Let alone a hundred years?
onalandline	losttexan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1821	Yeah, because Obama is really helping Seniors.
TheTaoOfBill	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1822	At least you can count on him not privatizing social security.
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1823	But you can count on him raising prices for health care.
Agent Zero	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1824	Surely private insurers would never do such a thing.
jthorp24	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1825	Key word... private.
jthorp24	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1825	Not government.
jthorp24	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1825	It's what they have to when a bunch of people who can't pay for healthcare, get it paid for by others.
jthorp24	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1825	Redistribution of wealth at it's finest.
jthorp24	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1825	Undeserving people riding the system on the $ of others.
Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1826	Not necessarily.
Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1826	There are 20 states repealling Obama care and the case is going to be heard.Take a look at this:http://www.silobreaker.com/judge-dec...81518310637623
jthorp24	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1827	
jthorp24	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1827	I sure hope this happens.
jthorp24	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1827	Especially since I live in Michigan.
jthorp24	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1827	I remember hearing this soon after it originally passed, but since I haven't really heard anything of it.
Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1828	Sorry, I did not realize my first post was botched up.
Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1828	It's one of those links where you keep clicking on them and I just fixed my post.I heard it on the news last night from one of the attorneys that are on this case.
Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1828	He had some good points on why he thinks this could go to the Supreme Court.
Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1828	I think most people are concerned about Medicare cuts and the Cap &amp; tax part of the bill.
Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1828	I am not altogether sure.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	So it's perfectly okay if large numbers of people are given the shaft so long as it's done by private companies?
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	If people are driven into bankruptcy, denied health care, that's fine so long as someone's getting rich off of it?
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	Personally.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	given the choice between having my health care administered by a private company that's unaccountable to anyone and has a profit motive to sit back and watch me suffer and die, and having it administered by a government agency that's ultimately accountable to the voters, I'll take the government.And how exactly do you decide who's undeserving?
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	If someone is poor they must obviously be that way because they're lazy or stupid or just generally a bad person, is that it?
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	You should be careful about saying that people deserve whatever they can squeeze out of the system.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	The real law of the jungle means *no* holds barred, period.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	A large part of the government's job is to level the playing field and ensure that everyone plays by the rules.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	Even Hammurabi said four millennia ago that he was given his throne &quot;so that the strong should not harm the weak.&quot; And we all benefit by living in a society where the government actually does a half decent job of it.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	Taxes are the price of living in a civilized society.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	I find it interesting that many of the same people who complain about people getting government benefits having a sense of entitlement seem to feel entitled themselves to the benefits of that civilized society without having to pay for it.
Jiyuu-Freedom	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1830	It's boils down to what is constitutional in the bill.
Jiyuu-Freedom	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1830	Private insurers will have much more say in what tests and procedures are approved in regards to your health care.
Jiyuu-Freedom	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1830	There is a panel who will make these decisions regarding your care in the Democratic bill that Congress passed.
Jiyuu-Freedom	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1830	Now concerning the cost and I am no economic major.
Jiyuu-Freedom	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1830	I do see where this is absolutely ludicrous.
jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	Rich people shouldn't be entitled to pay for anyones health care that is the problem.
jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	Healthcare is a service not a right.
jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	You don't have any right to someone else's money.
jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	You don't have the right to someone else's service.
jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	It's just an anomaly to think you are entitled to healthcare from a doctor.
jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	So if I want my lawn cared for...
jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	I should be entitled to someone else's service?
jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	Even if I can't afford it?
jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	The rich should pay for it?
jthorp24	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1832	I just can't get over how people think we are going to insure millions of new americans and it is going to lower the overall cost of healthcare.
jthorp24	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1832	It's just a lack of logic.
jthorp24	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1832	Nothing more than a bunch of sheep listening to their Messiah.
Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1833	Yes, and I failed to mention in my post that the Dems think it will actually reduce the deficit by $131 billion over 10 years.
Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1833	We need someone to do the math here.
Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1833	Have they mentioned the amount of tax revenue they plan to come up with?
Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1833	Not that I have heard.
Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1833	Anyone?
Dan40	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1834	$4 TO $6 BILLION in new taxes per year, plus insurance premiums from EVERYBODY, or a penalty for not buying, AND BEST OF ALL 500 BILLION DOLLARS WILL BE TAKEN FROM MEDICARE.
Dan40	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1834	IF all that is done, the CBO originally said obamacare would be deficit neutral over 10 years.
Dan40	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1834	But the CBO has already revised their cost estimate upward a couple of times and the program hasn't even started.So the politicians seeking re-election each year will have to publicly VOTE on the higher taxes each year, and those taxes will have to be higher than the first estimates.
Dan40	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1834	So the tax funding is unlikely.The premiums or penalty funding is already being challenged in 20 different court tests and WILL end up in the SCOTUS.And last, which re-election seeking politician from any party will take a dime from the 50+ million VOTING seniors on Medicare.
Dan40	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1834	It ain't gonna happen.So as usual a Govt program WILL cost 5 or more TIMES more than first estimated, [it happens all the time, and the opposite NEVER happens] and the tax funding WILL fall WAY short.
Dan40	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1834	The premium or penalty part will be found unconstitutional, so ZERO funding from that nonsense.
Dan40	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1834	And the Medicare dollars will never exist.If not repealed in 2013, when obama is sent back to re-organize ACORN in Chicago, the &quot;health insurance expansion bill&quot; will cost in excess of $5 TRILLION UNFUNDED DOLLARS.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	Sadly, jthorp, a social contract involves both rights and responsibilities.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	Like it or not, we are all part of one community, and all have a responsibility to make that community work.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	And ignoring the needs of a large segment of the population is one of the best ways I can think of to tear that community apart.We all benefit from living in a prosperous, peaceful society.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	Tell me, just how rich would the rich be if we couldn't count on the lights coming on when we flip the switch, clean water coming out of the tap, trash being whisked away, police and courts to protect us, and so on and so on?
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	An awful lot of that prosperity is due to the productive and technological capital that we've been building up for many many generations.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	How can any of us claim a special right to the legacy of our ancestors?
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	We all rely on it, whether we realize it or not.If you really want to just sit back and watch while people suffer and die, you're both immoral and a fool.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	If those on the bottom of the socio-economic ladder are kept impoverished with precious little real chance of advancement, what incentive do they have to buy into society?
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	And if large numbers of people stop buying into society, it's just going to fall apart.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	It's just plain flat out in the best interest of the wealthy to look after the lower classes, as well as being the only decent and moral thing to do.We live in an extraordinarily wealthy society, and we have both the ability and the responsibility to care for everyone.And before I hear the usual platitudes about hard work and personal responsibility...
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	Personal responsibility is very important.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	So is collective responsibility.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	We ignore either at our peril.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	And as admirable and necessary as hard work is, saying that all of society's ills would be solved if only everyone would work hard enough is naive.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	If all it takes is hard work to reach the pinnacle of society, why is anyone poor?
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	The fact is that not that many people manage to move really dramatically on the socio-economic scale.
Jollee	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1836	No! I will be for the Chamber of Commerce, who promotes small business and hiring!@
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	At what point is your wholly imaginary &quot;social responsibility&quot; met?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Today the top 25% of wealth pays 86.6% of our income tax and the next 27% pays the remaining 13.4% of our income tax.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Leaving 47% of the nation that TAKES out, rather than paying IN anything.We have a fiscal responsibility to fund the operations of the Govt.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	We do not have a social responsibility to support those that will not support themselves.CHARITY is there for that, Charity is the means for those that wish to exercise their own imagined &quot;social responsibility.&quot; And charity is encouraged through tax deductiblity.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	If you want more charity, work for more charitable tax deductions.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	What came first, the chicken or the egg?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Most all of what you cite above is a direct result of A PERSON deciding to INVEST, at great personal risk to themselves, their time, ideas, brainpower, future, and money.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Part of their decision might have been their genius, or their simple desire to improve something, but part was also for their own personal gain.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	The &quot;poor&quot; benefit from their accomplishments in technology and productivity.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Is it too much to ask that the investor that made it possible, enjoy the lion's share of their accomplishments without being vilified?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	&quot;Suffer and DIE&quot;?????????
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	That is next to non-existent in the USA.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Our &quot;poor&quot; are those families of 4 making $22,000.00 per year or less and our &quot;rich&quot; are those making $200,000.00 or more per year.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Both POLITICAL ARBITRARY numbers.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Based solely on vote buying, not reality.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Our &quot;poor&quot; have homes, cars, multiple TV's, cell phones, designer clothes, overnourished bodies, and a free education AVAILABLE.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	While 80% of our &quot;rich,&quot; make under $500,000.00 and are the primary source of small business job creation.You want to give more to those who already have more than they have earned by taking away from those who make it possible for the &quot;poor&quot; to have more than they have earned.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Hard work and personal responsibility are not &quot;platitudes.&quot; They are essentials to a free democratic republic functioning or not.&quot;COLLECTIVE&quot; is a favorite Communist word.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	There is no collective responsibility.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	&quot;My brothers keeper&quot; is a religious tenant, not a governmental one.Hard work is not ALL it takes to be successful.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	It takes brains, and determination, and ambition.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	And an idea and a goal.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	The poor have little of any of that AND for the most part, DO NOT work hard.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	When starting out in business, I worked harder, longer, and hopefully smarter than any employee I had.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	And less money, and sometimes NO money, went in my pocket, while the employees did get paid.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	All the while not KNOWING, but taking the chance, that what I was doing WOULD be successful.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Now retired, over the course of my working life I've provided jobs, GOOD jobs, for over 1000 people.But never for a minute did I hesitate to fire anyone trying to 'coast' through the job.This country became successful because we each have had an EQUAL OPPORTUNITY to try to become successful.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Nothing in our history, until liberalism, ever said everyone has an equal RIGHT to share in others success.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1841	Basic health and safety IS a right we provide in various other ways in this country, including police and fire departments!
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1841	Why is it suddenly wrong to provide the same health and safety in medicine, like every other developed nation does.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1841	People are dying and forcing their family into bankruptcy over medical bills and you're complaining about taxes?
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1841	I don't see how anyone arguing your position can call themselves a patriot.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1841	No one should be allowed to profit off of denying people health and safety.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1841	That's as simple as it gets.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1841	Food companies don't get away with it.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1841	Drug companies don't get away with it.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1841	And insurance companies shouldn't get away with it either.Maybe you should care less about the profits of insurance companies and more about the health and well being of your fellow Americans.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	Your arguments stand on the philosophy of Bleeding Heart Liberalism, NOTHING ELSE.You firmly believe in the liberal philosophy, Good fer you.However, as I've said many times before, your belief, your opinion, your philosophy.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A FACT.There are other philosophies, other beliefs, and other opinions.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	Just as righteous, just as provable, as yours.You &quot;CLAIM&quot; anarchy and chaos without your liberalism.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	That is plain and simple bullsh!t and that is a fact, not an opinion..
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	As I stated, CHARITY could solve EVERY problem liberalism purports to solve.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	WITHOUT enlarging the Govt to the point [LONG PAST] where we cannot afford our own State OR Federal Govts.It should be obvious to any clear thinker that Government is not an answer to anything.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	Government is a necessary drain on our lives and our economy and it must at all times be tightly controlled and minimized.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	We have NOT been doing that, Democrats or Republicans, and look at the financial horror we are in.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	How is that helping the poor?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	And it IS the Govt's fault that the poor are suffering.Liberals CLAIM to be seeking answers from the Govt, but in reality you're trying to make yourself feel good using other peoples money.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	And the present day looked at with 20/20 vision should show it does not and can not work.And has ALL that came before give me an advantage and a head start?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	Yes, ABSOLUTELY it did.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	THE EXACT SAME ADVANTAGE THAT EVERY LAZY WORTHLESS PARASITE GOT AS WELL.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	I just made the most of the same advantage instead of whining and looking for handouts.And how about an answer to the question.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	How much is ENOUGH?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	With the so called 25&#37; rich now paying 86.6% of all our income tax and your 'poor' and the remaining 47% of the public paying NOTHING.Should the rich pay 99.999%?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	And if you think that, I can tell you that many liberals would want much more.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	I'm sorry, I thought it was obvious that we're discussing philosophy at this point.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	And I **never** claimed to be righteous.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	I am not, never have been, and never will be righteous.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	I have no special insight, no divine inspiration, no special connection to some absolute Truth.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	And I most certainly do not have all the answers.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	I'm just one fallible person doing my best to figure things out and maybe contribute a little to making the community a bit better.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	If I'm wrong, then show me. Show me where I'm wrong, give me a convincing argument, or show me some evidence, and I'll change my mind if it measures up.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	But don't expect me to take you seriously if all you have is &quot;cause I say so.&quot;Chaos and anarchy are very real possibilities when the people at the top of the socio-economic ladder neglect those farther down.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	History is full of examples of revolts and revolutions when people are pushed too far.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	And even more examples of great civilizations falling into darkness when their leadership neglects the big picture.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	From the First Intermediate Period of Ancient Egypt to the Russian Revolution of 1917, chaos and anarchy is a specter that our society has always lived with.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	And if we let things fall apart, it *can* happen here.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	The US is subject to the same forces as every other nation in our world's history.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	If we wish to avoid the fate of so many of our predecessors, we need to learn from their examples, both what they did right and what they did wrong.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	As crucial as it is to safeguard the rights of the individual, we need to keep an eye on the big picture, too.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	Neither can be neglected if we want this grand experiment we call the United States to succeed in the long term.Tell me, why do you think government assistance programs were instituted in the first place?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	Because private charities simply weren't getting the job done.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	Government is not inherently evil, any more then any other social institution.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	It is simply a tool, and whether it does good or ill depends entirely on how it's used.Do you honestly believe that poverty (as relative a term as that is) exists solely because those who aren't rich are all &quot;lazy worthless parasites&quot;?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	You see poverty as only being a personal moral failing?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	Then why in the world is poverty still a social issue?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	Do you think it's fun being poor?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	Do you think that living on government benefits gives you a luxurious lifestyle?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	Then you need a serious reality check, my friend.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	I assure you that none of that is even remotely true.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	And generally speaking, the poor most definitely do not use benefits to buy designer clothes.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	Paying the basic bills is enough of a challenge, I promise you.How much is enough?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	There is never a firm answer to that.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	It's something that we as a community must decide through the political process, through consensus and compromise, through actually listening to each other.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	What we need are practical, pragmatic people from all over the political spectrum to talk, to give us their points of view, to make suggestions, to be as forceful an advocate for their positions as possible.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	We need to take the best that each of us has to offer, even the parts that you don't agree with.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	But we need serious ideas, not, &quot;I don't want to pay taxes,&quot; not, &quot;But why should *I* have to so something about it?&quot; not, &quot;Hey, man, it's not my job.&quot;
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	The revolts in the past have been against &quot;the power&quot; being used to stop individualism and freedom.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	Pretty much what liberalism is trying to do now.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	There have been NO revolts in history against a free market.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	Right now LIBERALS in Europe are revolting, striking, and looting and destroying, and even KILLING because the fiscal mess cannot be supported any longer and they are losing a tiny bit of their FREEBIES.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	And for that they are willing to kill.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	That is LIBERALS willing to kill to keep their unsustainable giveaway programs.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	You cannot SEE the danger there?????Conservatives are trying to say and have said for years, &quot;Let's NOT follow Europe, let Europe follow us.&quot; But liberals insisted that we follow Europe.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	Can you not see where that ends.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	Bankrupt countries, fiscally AND morally bankrupt under the guise of doing good and being 'compassionate.You ask for proof, you ask I make a good argument against liberalism, Simple, EUROPE!Europe should be the little kid tagging along behind and trying to get the big kids to play with them.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	Instead, if we do not change our ways, Europe is showing us our own bleak future.ENABLING people to BE poor is what liberalism does.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	It does nothing to ennoble people it only enables them.Liberals say that placing demands on the poor is demeaning them.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	That is the exact opposite of the truth.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	MAKE them earn everything, and they will find ambition, pride, self esteem, and drive.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	And personal responsibility.If we can afford to give to the poor, we can afford to make work for them to do instead.And your claim that charity was not doing the job is completely fallacious.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	No giveaway programs were started to make up a charitable shortfall.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	ALL giveaway programs have one purpose and one purpose only.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	And that is not to help the poor, it is to help the politician buy votes.And NO conservative is saying, &quot;I don't want to pay taxes.&quot; We are saying, &quot;We refuse to pay even MORE taxes until the Govt stops wasting 50 cents of every tax dollar we pay now.&quot;
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	Why on earth would we pay for permanent jobs for the poor?!
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	Assistance is only supposed to be a temporary thing.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	Providing jobs just for the sake of providing jobs has the potential to be a lifelong commitment!
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	It would cost more money for about the same amount of benefit!
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	The only jobs government should be creating for the sake of improving the economy is temporary jobs.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	And they should only be creating those in times of economic slowdown.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	We don't want to set ourselves up for a bunch of life long commitments unless it's going to seriously improve our economy.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	Temporary assistance is all most poor people need.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	Most people on welfare get off it within a few years because they are able to find a job and support their family.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	Welfare helps the poor get back to work.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1846	&quot;WELFARE HELPS THE POOR GET BACK TO WORK!&quot;HOW???There is NOTHING temporary about the giveaway programs we have for the poor.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1846	The only changes to the giveaway programs is they get increased.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1847	It's a fact that the average welfare family only stays on welfare for a few years that the most.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1847	The welfare life is not a life of luxury.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1847	People want to get off it as soon as possible.And welfare does help people get back to work in that it keeps demand up in recessions which causes businesses to hire again sooner.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1847	In the end welfare saves us more money than it costs because welfare is a recession buster.Want to end a recession quickly and effectively?
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1847	Increase foodstamps and extend welfare benefits.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1848	And pass the costs on to INFINITY?Only 2 things wrong with your &quot;plan.&quot;1.It doesn't work2.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1848	We cannot afford it.A Govt is no different than you and I. If we keep running out of money before the end of the year, we KNOW we have to CHANGE what we've been doing.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1848	And since, like the Govt, we can only marginally increase our revenue, we must stop our outflow.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1848	That is not painless or welcome to an individual or a Govt.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1848	Things that cannot be avoided and MUST be done are seldom relished.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1848	But still must be done.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1848	There is NO alternative choice except for things to get worse and worse until collapse!
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	Welfare has already been proven to work.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	Hence why it's been around for 80 years.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	Hence why every economic school teaches that an extension of welfare benefits is an economic stimulus.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	Back before republicans went crazy stupid they knew this fact as well.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	Extention of welfare in bad times used to be a bipartisan thing because everyone who knew anything about economics knows welfare benefits the economy like every school child knows the earth rotates around the sun.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	Just because you don't understand how it works doesn't mean it doesn't work.We aren't running out of money because welfare costs too much.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	We're running out of money because our taxes have been way too low for about 30 years now.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	Since Reagan cut them.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	Conservatives would rather see more in their paycheck then see a country where people do not starve to death or die of a curable disease simply because they couldn't afford food and medicine.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	And they think they are following Jesus in doing so.
TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	What a joke.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1850	Welfare did start under a liberal president in the 1930's.
Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1850	It worked so well that the Great Depression ended shortly after the end of WWII in the later 1940's.

jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1851	Are you going to help pay for it?
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1851	You know, since you are such a &quot;patriot.&quot;
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1853	What does lawn care have to do with health and safety?
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1853	We're talking about people dieing of curable disease.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1853	That's not at all comparable.
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1854	Because I'm going to get depressed if my lawn doesn't look good.

Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1855	Sadly, around 20% of Americans still are liberals.And you just played the race card against an opponent.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1855	Not because your opponent is racist, but because its the only thing your Kool-Aid purveyors have taught you to do.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1856	Your last 2 paras are liberal dreaming of a perfect world that WILL NOT happen.

TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1857	A lot of Americans choose the latter.

TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1857	And no body should be forced to put their family into debt to survive.

TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1857	And it's because there are too many people in this country that would prefer to see a few extra dollars in their paycheck then see a country where no one has to choose between death and supporting their family.Disgusting.

jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1858	It's a lot more money, through taxes and insurance.
jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1858	It's worse healthcare for the people paying for the healthcare.

jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1858	There isn't any.

RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1864	Then would you not agree that it was a good thing our brave soldiers ended up getting rid of him and at least hundreds of his secret death squad police?

TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	And I will cite this one:http://washingtonindependent.com/634...pending-by-0-2The cbo estimated that only .5&#37; savings would come out of tort reform.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	And .2 of that .5% would come from people being less likely to use medical services.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	In other words because of the fact that Tort reform has already passed in most states, a nationwide tort reform would do next to nothing in terms of healthcare savings.
TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	Are you really this daft?

TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	Basic healthcare is the ability to get regular checkups.

Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	They say things like between 2000 and 2006 17,700 uninsured people died with preventable diseases.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	Did they die because they had no insurance?
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	NO, they died because they did not do check ups, did not take care of themselves.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	You and the liberal idiots will say that's because they had no insurance, that's why they did not get check up's.Here is a simple fact, not an opinion, that even liberals should be capable of understanding.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	It costs MORE to have insurance to pay for check ups than it would to pay for check ups on our own.Insurance IS a for profit business.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	IF they did not charge more in premiums than they pay out, they would not be able to pay for anyone's care for anything.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	And the insurance companies profits are regulated by politicians.So obamacare changes nothing there except trade state politicians for federal politicians.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	And you wanna bet the state politicians keep their expensive jobs while a whole new set of federal politicians and bureaucrats come on the scene and PAYROLL.And the people that died for the own lack of caring for themselves, COULD have gone to their COUNTY HEALTH SERVICE [an already in place Govt health care plan] for regular medical care.
Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	They would have paid for routine care according to their individual ability to pay Again obamacare does no change here just adds a layer of costs to already existing programs long in place.

TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1873	There are profitable insurance companies in Europe and Canada.

TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1873	It forces insurance companies to take in preexisting conditions.

Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1895	No one ever said it would.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1895	Have you not been paying attention at all?
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1895	As I said, the health care law was aimed primarily at expanding coverage and reforming insurance regulation.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1895	It has several measures aimed at improving efficiency in the health care system and works to shift the focus of treatment away from expensive specialists and toward preventive care and general practitioners, all of which should help contain costs in the long run.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1895	But cost containment is not and was never said to be the main intent.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1895	There are also several pilot programs in the law to explore ways to contain costs, but there are no easy answers.
Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1895	Besides, with a growing population, and rising costs far in excess of inflation, it would be virtually impossible to actually reduce the total costs.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1896	No, health care is not a right.

Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1896	As crappy as things are, they'd be a lot worse without the stimulus.

Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1896	And yes, Dan, that is an opinion.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1896	An opinion strongly supported by evidence and shared by most economists.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1896	And your opinion that it hasn't helped still has absolutely no support of any kind whatsoever.Bush took us from a surplus to a recurring, structural deficit during a time of prosperity mainly for the sake of giving the wealthiest Americans large tax breaks.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1896	Obama came into office in the middle of the worst recession since the Great Depression, and ran up a deficit with one time stimulus measures to prevent the economy from collapsing completely.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1896	Plus, a large portion of the current deficit is simply due to lower tax revenues because of the bad economy.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1896	Once the economy recovers and the stimulus money is spent, Obama's contribution to the deficit will almost completely disappear.Deficit spending during a national emergency (such as a severe recession) is a good thing, a necessary thing.

Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Since you seemed to have completely missed the extensive discussion on the subject, I will repeat my main post on the subject:In March 2009, only a month after the stimulus passed, the National Association of Business Economists conducted an industry survey in which 10.3% of economists forecast a strong impact on the economy, 60.3% a modest impact, and 29.4% little to no impact.http://www.nabe.com/graphweek/2009/gw090329.htmlAround a year after the stimulus was passed, studies done by IHS Global Insight, Macroeconomic Advisers and Moody’s Economy.com all estimated that the stimulus created 1.6 million to 1.8 million jobs to date and that its ultimate impact will be roughly 2.5 million jobs.http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/bu...leonhardt.htmlThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the effects of the stimulus in the last quarter of 2009 were 2.1 million jobs created, GDP boosted by 3.5%, and unemployment improved by 2.1% Their estimate for the first quarter of 2010 is 2.8 million jobs and 4.2% GDP.Unfortunately I had to rely on Wikipedia for these numbers http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulu..._under_the_Act because the PDF's on the CBO's website aren't working for me. http://www.cbo.gov/Even Ben Stein, as conservative an economist as you could wish for and certainly no fan of the Obama administration, implies in an article discussing the failure of Lehman Brothers that the stimulus and bailouts were both necessary and at least somewhat effective.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	&quot;But the losses to the economy following the failure of Lehman have been on the order of hundreds of billions, maybe trillions.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Certainly the rescue and stimulus packages needed in the wake of the Lehman failure have amounted to the trillions.&quot; While I certainly can't speak for Mr Stein, I would imagine he would argue that the stimulus money could have been better spent to much more effect, but that's not the same as saying that the stimulus has had no effect at all or even made things worse.http://spectator.org/archives/2010/0...-of-depressionIn any case, $288 billion of the stimulus, 37% of the total, went to tax breaks of various kinds.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Are you going to argue that tax cuts don't stimulate the economy, onalandline?Basically, it comes down to this.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Are you going to deny that we were on the brink of another great depression?
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Are you going to deny that we've moved back from the brink since then?
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	You can argue exactly how much the stimulus helped the economy, and you can certainly make the case that the money could have been spent more effectively.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	But if you want to say that the stimulus had no effect at all, I'm afraid you're going to have to back that up with something fairly substantial.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Maybe the economy would have stopped short of the brink on its own, and maybe it wouldn't have.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Do you really think we should have taken that risk and done nothing?
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	and once again we come back to the simple question, which is preferable, 10% unemployment, or 25%?Yes, the current deficits are history-making and record-breaking.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Because the recession is history-making and record-breaking.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Most of the increase in the deficit under Obama has been due to the recession, either directly to the lost tax revenue caused by dropping GDP or to the various stimulus and bailout measures to combat the recession.

Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Unless there's a recession, tax revenues pretty much always go up, regardless.

Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	So the blanket statement that lowering taxes always increases revenues is patently false.

Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	It decreases the rate of taxes paid, which tends to decrease revenues.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	And it stimulates the economy, which enlarges the tax base, which tends to increase revenues.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	When tax rates are very high, the economic stimulus effect predominates.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	When taxes are very low, the decreased rates predominate.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	There's a curve, with peak revenues somewhere in the middle.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	The question is which side of the curve we're on right now?
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Considering that current US tax rates are really very low, both by historical US standards and compared to other industrialized countries, and considering that Bush's tax cuts clearly created a large deficit, I think the answer is fairly obvious.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Then why has it been used by Presidents of both parties and all philosophies in every economic downtown since the Great Depression?

Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	How?
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	By whom?
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Creating an ideological rationalization about why something that worked really didn't doesn't change the reality of the situation.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Speaking of ideology, it seems awfully convenient that yours seems to think that all ills can be cured with the same medicine - you not having to pay taxes.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Where did this mad notion that the deficit is somehow equivalent to a bad economy come from, anyway?
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	That makes no sense.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	The relationship between the deficit and the economy is complex, and can't be whittled down to a simple one to one correspondence.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	In some circumstances a deficit can help the economy, in others hurt it, and it still others have no appreciable effect at all.On what basis do you claim that Obama has created any recurring deficit at all, or that it will last decades?
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Most of the increase of the deficit under Obama have been due to falling revenues caused by the recession, and stimulus measures.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	The stimulus is *not* a recurring expense, it has an end date.
Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Name one thing in the stimulus that doesn't.

Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1903	I don't believe in ideology.

Iriemon	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1958	As GDP figures were ultimately calculated, GDP never went down in two consecutive quarters, which is the classic test of a recession, and in the worst year, FY2001, real GDP increased 1.1%, and actual GDP increased over 3%.I know you didn't compare them, but the 2001 &quot;recession,&quot; if it is even fair to call it a recession (I know the NBER classified it as such) was a much different beast that the recession Obama inherited.

TheTaoOfBill	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1964	Actually no there was no recession in 2000-2001.
TheTaoOfBill	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1964	A recession is 2 sequential quarters of economic shrinkage.

TheTaoOfBill	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1964	So there was never a recession.
TheTaoOfBill	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1964	Just a slowdown.

jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1982	Logic would tell us that?

jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1982	We spent $860 billion.
jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1982	Next to nothing has been done.
jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1982	Just wait until the effects of the wasted money.
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1983	Logic would tell us if the Govt hadn't pumped a few hundred billion in spending into the economy creating demand for jobs and paying for jobs for folks who would otherwise have been fired, unemployment would have gotten much higher and the recession would be worse.Conservatives tell us all the time that tax cuts spur economic growth, so if you believe that, logic would tell you that the hundreds of billions in tax cuts had an efffect as well and that the economy would have been worse and unemployment higher without it.Finally, logic tells us from empirical data, including FDR's new deal and WWII, that Govt spending stimulates the economy, and finally the fact that in this period the fact the economy went from tanking -7&#37; real and losing 700,000 jobs a month to growing and the private sector adding jobs suggests the stimulus had a positive effect, as the bi-partisan and most economists agree.While $860 billion is a lot, I agree, and it is almost as much money wasted in the mistaken war in Iraq, comparatively it represents just over 5% of the economy.
Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1983	Given that both Govt spending and the deficit were cut in FY2010, we shouldn't be surprised that this modest amount of stimulus, while logic and evidence suggest it helped turn the economy around and stop getting worse, wasn't sufficiently large to really set it on fire.Unfortunately, fiscal mismanagement by the prior three Republican administrations left the nation in such a precarious state of debt that only a limited amount of stimulus was prudent.

Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	obama IS increasing the debt by $1.5 TRILLION per year.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	And you liberals claim Bush was terrible.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	You ARE right, Bush was terrible [and he was &quot;the Govt.&quot;] and now obama is the Govt and he is 2.4 times WORSE than Bush.Why does Freddie and Fannie now need ANOTHER $300+ BILLION to further bail them out?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	Because F&amp;F invented, bought, and guaranteed the fictitious &quot;sub-prime&quot; loans.The free market did not invent those worthless loans, calling them what they are, F&amp;F &amp; &quot;THE GOVT did that for the good of all of us.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	Liberals scream about the ruthless crooks on Wall Street.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	TARP was passed in a DEMOCRAT Congress, and TARP bailed out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,wait for it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WALL STREET!!Would it have been better if the Govt had stayed out of the free market?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	YES.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	If they HAD, maybe there would NOT have even been a recession.You want proof that you're drinking the liberal Kool-Ade and that the stimulus has failed?Look to the politicians feeding you that Kool-Ade.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	Are they running for re-election on the merits of obamacare?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	NO!Are they running on the great jobs reports?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	NO!Are they running on the great Stimulus plan?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	NO!Their campaigns are one thing and one thing only.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	My opponent is worse than me. NOT how much good I've done, instead, my opponent will be even worse!Can't you read between the lines of what your own liberal politicians are saying?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	They're saying, the pooch is screwed, and you can't hear them because your ears are full of the Kool-Ade.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	The only brain washing going on here has convinced you that the fairy tales about the free market are in fact accurate.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	Government is not the answer to many problems, you are right.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	Unfortunately for the narrative you are trying to convince us of, government at other times actually IS the answer.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	No one believes government should solve all problems, or even most problems, that is a straw man invented the the believers in the laissez faire fairy tale.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	The reality is, government did play a role in the current economic crisis, but the reality is also that the market did as well.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	Government did keep interest rates too low, but they also deregulated the whole industry(that means less government, not more), and the market failed.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	Banks did act incompetently.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	They did, when given more freedom, cause a massive problem.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	The same is true of consumers of housing.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	People bought houses they couldn't afford, not because government made them, but because they made irrational decisions.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	Irrational decisions are not taken into account in the laissez faire fairy tale story.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	Nor are market failures, externalities, etc.But that is the problem some of us are able to see the problems government solves and the problems it creates.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	We don't need a black and white world where X is the problem and Y is the solution.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	Not when the reality is that sometimes X IS a problem, but it is also sometimes a solution.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	Just like Y is sometimes a solution, but it can also be a problem as well.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	That is the reality of the market(I don't call it the free market, as that is a mythical concept made up in the laissez faire fairy tales.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	It is sort of like a unicorn), it can do some things extraordinarily well, but cannot do others things as well.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	Government is the same.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	But that takes a level of nuance and recognition of complexity that too many are incapable of recognizing.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	I really do tire of the simplistic arguments where either government is the source of all problems, or greedy corporations are the source of all problems.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	The reality is they are both capable of doing good things as well as bad.

frodly	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2001	Is this meant to be a folksy home truth that offers some simple insight into the issue at hand?

Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	[giggles] My ears are full of Kool-Ade?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Dan, I think your metaphor has kinda derailed here.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Look, like I've said before, I'm a pragmatist - I go with what works, and I go where the evidence leads me. If you want to convince me of your position, then show me evidence.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Or a thorough argument.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Or *something* that's a reason to think that.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Just saying that government is evil and always the problem over and over isn't going to cut it, you need to show how and why government is the problem.No one is saying that the market is evil or needs to be done away with or the source of nothing but problems.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Well, at least not anyone with an ounce of sense.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	The free market is an extraordinarily powerful engine for creating material wealth.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	But that's really all it does.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	As I've previously pointed out, the market left to its own devices can create some pretty bad situations.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	It needs to be balanced with other institutions.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	That doesn't necessarily need to be government, but at least so far, government has been the most effective (if very imperfect) tool for doing that.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	If you have a better suggestion, please share it.I am not especially interested in laying blame for this recession.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	I'm much more interested in figuring out what to do *now.* I agree completely that the seeds of this recession go way back, and many hands helped plant them.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	But that doesn't help us find a way out of it now.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	As I said before, fiscal stimulus is about the only tool available to the President and Congress to fight a recession.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	If you have a suggestion for something else to try, please share that too.In general, I believe in balanced budgets, and don't like deficit spending.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	But there are times when deficits are both appropriate and necessary.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Just like you should generally keep your family budget balanced, but sometimes you need to borrow because of unusual circumstances.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	A family emergency, an accident or other unforeseen expense not covered by insurance, etc. The comparison between Presidents Bush and Obama is not about how big their deficits are, but what they're being run up for.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	President Bush ran up a recurring structural deficit during a time of prosperity primarily to fund tax cuts for the top earners.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	This would be sort of like quitting your well paying full time career and instead taking a part time job, without changing your spending.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	President Obama, on the other hand, has run up a deficit with emergency, limited spending to deal with the current crisis.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	This is more analogous to if you had a fire in your house, and your insurance didn't give you enough coverage to fix everything, so you take out a loan to get things back to how they should be.I don't like bailouts any more then you do, but they are necessary.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Just look at the damage letting Lehman Brothers fail caused.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	What would have happened if we'd allowed, what was it?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Something like a dozen major companies?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	What if we'd let all of them fail at the same time?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Sometimes life doesn't give you any good options, and you have to choose the least bad one.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Surely you ran into situations like that running your business, when you had to make a hard choice between the lesser of two evils?Yes, the stimulus *has* worked, just not enough.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	We've been over this at length already, do I need to go over the CBO reports, unemployment and GDP figures, independent economic analyzes, surveys of economists, and all of that *again*?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	This will be, what, the fourth time now?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Something like that.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	You had no answer to all that evidence before, do you have one now?As for the way Democrats are running their campaigns this year, I have to admit I am completely mystified.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	But then political campaigns are often not governed by reason and facts...
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	I'm not much for laying blame either.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	But in this case, the blame is on &quot;THE GOVT,&quot; the same people you hope will fix WHAT THEY BROKE!
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	Not Democrats, Not Republicans, not liberals, not conservatives--------POLITICIANS of both parties caused our recession, unknowingly, and have no knowledge of how to fix it.Over and over, and over again, you post like liberal OPINIONS ARE FACTS, They are not facts same as my posting aren't facts unless I can point to a proof.You say Stimulus HAS worked, just not enough.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	That is FAILURE.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	That is the rewarding of the mediocre as liberals are wont to do.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	TRYING is just trying.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	DOING is accomplishment.What happens if this company fails or that company fails?SOMETHING ELSE TAKES THEIR PLACE.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	That is the free market.obamalama said GM must not fail, Many of your 'esteemed' economists said GM must not fail.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	GM did fail and is still an unconstitutional Government manufacturing company.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	In the process of becoming a Govt manufacturing co., &quot;THE GOVT,&quot; violated long existing bankruptcy laws as they were inconvenient to the Govt.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	Bond holders got screwed, the taxpayer got screwed, and GM was GIFTED to the UAW in exchange for votes.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	And &quot;THE GOVT&quot; that you place SO much faith in, sweetened the pot for the UAW and GIFTED $60 BILLION in cash in addition to the bailout billions.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	Then this same wonderful GOVT claims that GM paid back all of the bailout.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	Yes they did, they paid it back with part of the $60 billion in WORTHLESS STOCK &quot;THE GOVT&quot; purchased for GM.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	Stock presently worth $00.75, IF it were traded.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	AND THAT IS A FACT!!AND&quot;THE GOVT,&quot; GAVE Chrysler to FIAT.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	Someday we will learn why, other than somehow helping the UAW more.How much do you REFUSE to see?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	There is much, much more.

JLB	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2006	I intend to stay on the porch and not run with the big dogs, and I suggest you do the same.

frodly	Lophophora	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2011	Or at least stop making predictions.....
frodly	Lophophora	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2011	I guess some people never learn.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	Dan, breaking the economy and fixing it are two different things.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	While what was done wrong to get us here is important to learn from in making decisions in the future, giving the economy a boost now *is* something we know how to do.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	Fiscal stimulus has been being used successfully by administrations of both parties since the Great Depression.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	And as I've already shown, there is ample evidence that the stimulus *has* helped the economy.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	You insist on clinging to the sliver of uncertainty inherent in everything in life just because you don't like where the evidence leads.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	That's your privilege, of course, but you can't expect anyone else to pay attention to you if that's what you choose to do.If you hit a nail with a hammer, and the nail is only driven partway in, do you declare the hammer a failure and toss it away, or do you hit the nail again?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	If *one* company is going under, then sure, let the market do its thing, even if it's a really big one.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	But if there are a lot of large companies all going under at the same time?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	As a thought experiment, consider the extreme case - if every company in the country failed at the same time.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	It would be a total disaster, right?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	Each company that fails represents a hit to the economy.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	Individually, each failure is small enough that the economy as a whole can handle it.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	But if you get too much at one time, especially if the economy is already weak, it can cause a real problem.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	The economy is resilient and can take a lot of punishment, but there is a limit.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2014	You present the &quot;Doomsday Scenario,&quot; and of course, the result would be Doomsday, SURPRISE.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2014	The idea of bailing out Wall Street WAS to ease the credit crunch.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2014	They took the money and kept it and now report record profits, while not easing credit at all.How many would have failed?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2014	YOU DO NOT KNOW and I don't know and obamalama doesn't know.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2014	But it sure looks like crooked but not so smart politicians got hosed by crooked but smarter businessmen.
JLB	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2015	I can see you can't stop thinking about me...

JLB	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2016	That would suit your capacity very well.Be all that you can be.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	I only meant it as a thought experiment to point out that if a lot of large companies all fail at once, that would have larger implications beyond just those companies.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Obviously I'm not suggesting that there's any possibility that every company in the country could actually fail at the same time, that's a rather silly scenario if taken literally.No, nobody knows how many would have failed if the government had done nothing.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	But we do know that Lehman Brothers *did* fail, and it had major repercussions for the entire economy, and helped push us into recession.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	And we do know that quite a few large financial firms were also in trouble at the same time.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Would it really have been worth the risk to do nothing?And I'm no happier about the behavior of a lot of those firms after they got the bailout money then you are, but what can we do?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Should Congress try to pass a law to make them do the right thing?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Of course not, talk about government intruding on the market, and it probably wouldn't work anyway.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	So the choice we have is, do we hold our noses and help a bunch of undeserving schmucks solely because they've managed to worm their way into important positions, or do we let them go down and take the risk they'll take the rest of down with them?Besides, a lot of the TARP money has been paid back, and I believe the program is actually expected to turn a nice profit for the taxpayer when all is said and done.As for the stimulus...
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	If each time you hit the nail it's driven in just a tiny bit, even if it's a microscopic amount, after a trillion hits you'll have moved the nail appreciably, even if it's not been driven all the way home yet.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Besides, what else are you going to do if you toss the hammer aside?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Try to drive in the nail with your mind?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	[j/k] We've gone from a major recession with a shrinking economy shedding jobs at a breathtaking rate to a stagnant economy with stable yet unacceptably high unemployment.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	That *is* progress, even if we still have a long way to go yet.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	And there is plenty of evidence, as I've shown, that the stimulus helped.When it comes to the campaign...
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	[shrugs] What can I say?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Democrats are a bunch of wimps?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	I really don't know what's going on with them.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	I've heard some talking heads on TV speculate that the people running the campaigns think that, &quot;It may be bad, but it would have been a lot worse if we'd done nothing,&quot; is too complicated an argument to get across in a campaign.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	I've no idea if they had any idea what they were talking about or not.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	It seems like the Democrats lost the spin war and just kinda gave up.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Don't ask me why.It seems to me (yes, this is purely my impression) that people are upset about the economy and scared for their future.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Which is, of course, completely understandable and justified.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	But a lot of times people who are scared and upset react more emotionally, maybe the Dems are afraid that people are too emotional right now to listen to facts and figures?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	I really don't know, I'm purely speculating here.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2018	They have you thoroughly and completely brainwashed.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2018	The liberal party line, the public is confused, the public is scared, the public is emotional.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2018	And here you are, insulting us just like your masters do.We are not confused, we know what is going on.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2018	We are not afraid.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2018	We are a bit emotional, PISSED about being talked down to by an incompetent idiot whose strings are being pulled by Soros, pissed about being insulted, pissed about being told we don't know what we're doing, and pissed about the bastardization of the American Dream.And pissed about The Communist idea of &quot;redistribution of the wealth.&quot; And pissed about ruinous wasteful spending with NO plan to pay it back.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2018	Pissed about a long string of lies, bribes, earmarks, and technicalities used to pass a health-care INSURANCE bill that up to 70% of the nation does not want.So yes we are emotional to get this puppet clown out of power and then out of office.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	I'm sorry if what I said sounded condescending or insulting, that wasn't my intent at all.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	So please accept my apology, I retract what I said about it.However, I do question whether it's a good idea to judge what's going on in the real world based on what politicians say, especially politicians running for office.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	Wait a minute Dan, that almost sounds like you're complaining about the government *not* spending money.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	LOL Isn't it a good thing if it took less money to deal with the problem then was originally thought?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	I don't know for sure how much, if any, of the bailout money has been paid back, and I don't really want to argue about it.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	(To be honest, I just don't feel like doing the work to come up with hard numbers.)
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	That's not really the point.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	TARP was designed to keep the financial system from completely collapsing, which it did.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	Do you think liberals *wanted* to bail out Wall Street?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	We had to do it because the danger of severe damage to the economy was too great.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	Besides, Dan, what would you be saying now about the government's incompetence if the bailouts hadn't happened, and it had dropped the floor out from under the economy?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	Once again, unrelentingly, you present opinions as facts.The floor DID drop out of the economy.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	Would it have been worse, OR NOT?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	We do not know.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	But we do know that the problems WERE caused by politicians.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	To push the politicians to the side and LET the FREE MARKET WORK, could have been the much wiser thing to do.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	But while there is no proof of that, neither is there any proof that letting the people that caused the problems continue to manipulate the free market to their own ends was wise either.WE ARE where we are now.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	And the people in power now have had and do have but one single plan.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	BORROW MORE, SPEND MORE BORROWED MONEY!Sorry that you are unable to realize that the majority of Americans do not agree with that &quot;plan.&quot;This from a liberal site:10/04/2010The federal government&#8217;s unpopular &#8211; and often vilified &#8212; $700 billion bailout program officially came to an end when the clock struck midnight early Monday morning.The Troubled Asset Relief Program&#8217;s (TARP) formal sunset date means that no new programs will be funded under the initiative and no more money will be doled out to prop up ailing banks, although existing programs &#8211; such as the government&#8217;s foreclosure prevention efforts &#8211; will continue to run their course with the money that&#8217;s already been allotted.Capitalists, tax-paying Americans, and even lawmakers who voted for the bill that made TARP possible two yearsago to the day have criticized the government&#8217;s massive intervention in the financial system.Initially, this monumental rescue effort was expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars &#8211; a figure that prompted outcries and protests across the nation.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	But with banks now turning a profit and repaying their TARP dollars, and even the automakers and insurance giant AIG expected to be able to pay back at least part of their capital injections, the program&#8217;s price tag has shrunk to a fraction of that.The latest reports on the Treasury&#8217;s estimates put the total cost of TARP at less than $50 billion.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	Some officials have even gone so far as to say they expect the government&#8217;s bailout efforts to actually turn a profit for taxpayers when all is said and done.Numbers released by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in August are not too far off from the Treasury&#8217;s figures.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	CBO&#8217;s assessment is that TARP will carry an expense of $66 billion.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	Treasury says $50 billion, CBO says $66 billion, liberal writer says, &quot;not too far off.&quot; Just $16,000,000,000.00 OFFTHEY-DON'T-KNOW- WHAT-THEY-ARE-DOING!

Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	You'll note the LOL on the end?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	And once again, unrelentingly, you try to avoid reality by calling it an opinion and pretending that makes it equally valid to claim that the stimulus hurt the economy.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	That makes as much sense as saying that the idea of a round Earth is an opinion (which it is) and therefore it is equally valid to say that the Earth is flat.Why are you so determined to cling to an idea that both all the evidence and your own theory says is wrong?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	37% of the stimulus was tax breaks, and I have yet to hear *anyone* claim that tax cuts don't stimulate the economy.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	I've repeatedly challenged you to come up with a single shred of evidence that says the stimulus didn't help the economy and you've repeatedly utterly and completely failed.In any case, are you seriously suggesting that if the financial sector had completely collapsed that things wouldn't have been much, much worse?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	As in Great Depression levels of worse?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	Is that 100% absolutely certain?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	Of course not, nothing in life is. It's not 100% absolutely certain the sun will rise in the East tomorrow morning.Yes, politicians are human and fallible, and yes they don't entirely know what they're doing.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	Just like everyone else in the world.

Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	Nobody forced the banks to make all those subprime mortgages, nobody forced the banks to encourage people to borrow more then they could afford, and no one forced them to bundle those bad debts as derivatives that have lead to so much grief.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	The politicians bear a lot of blame for getting us where we are.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	So does the market.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	Your argument about &quot;Why should we trust politicians to get us out of this mess when they're the ones who got us in it,&quot; can just as easily be applied to the market.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	There is no one single villain in this story, and there's no single quick fix, either.And as for the $16,000,000,000.00, you seem to have no sense of scale when it comes to money.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	that sum can just as easily be expressed as 0.016 petadollars or as 1,600,000,000,000,000 millicents.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	So what?

SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2027	say what...?!?!?!
frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2028	The statement is perfectly coherent.
frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2028	You need to read it again.
SideTraKd	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2029	And, as is normally the case with liberal meme's, it is completely divorced from reality.
frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2030	Is it?
frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2030	And as is normally the case with the right wing meme, it is completely divorced from the truth.
frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2030	No one did force the banks to do those things.
frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2030	So what exactly was objectionable about the statement, other than it was a reality which clashed with your preconceived notions.
SideTraKd	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2031	The fact that the statement was about as divorced from reality as it could get.
SideTraKd	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2031	Of course, you live in opposite world, so we don't expect you to understand.Banks were indeed pressured into giving low income (read sub-prime) loans.
SideTraKd	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2031	People were widely encouraged to enter into home ownership, despite the fact that they could not afford it, and it was the GSEs, through government pressure, that started the entire practice of sub-prime bundling.So yeah...
SideTraKd	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2031	What he said was true, if by &quot;true&quot; you mean &quot;completely false&quot;.
frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2032	Almost everything you say here is an easily disproven lie.

frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2032	The government was involved in the subprime industry, but 85% of all subprime mortgages were issues by private industries.http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2008/10/1...ixzz12xTyWY91AI suggest you read this as well.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/a...articleid=1812The reality is, the largest role government played in the creation and collapse of the housing bubble, was keeping interests far too low for far too long.
frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2032	Not Fannie and Freddy, nor government forcing banks to give loans(it didn't happen), etc.Securitization of debt was also not something forced on the banks by government.
frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2032	It has a long history, and I cannot imagine where you came up with the idea that it was forced onto anyone by banks(for future reference, it is best to provide links to support such absurd claims).
frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2032	Read up a bit on it's history.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SecuritizationSubprime bundling is 100% a phenomenon of private institutions.
frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2032	You really need to either educate yourself and read up on these issues, or stop reading dishonest sources that lie and distort the facts.
frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2032	The reality is government certainly had a role to play in causing this crisis, but they were not the only catalyst, nor the main catalyst.
frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2032	There is plenty of blame to share between government, banks, and people who took out debt they couldn't possible service.
frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2032	Your schewed dishonest partisan view of the issue, means it is best not to make declarative statements, because when it comes to this issue, you don't know what you are talking about.
SideTraKd	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2033	The government was the initial mover of sub-prime loans.
SideTraKd	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2033	They were the ones that initially pushed banks into issuing loans, and, because those loans were so risky, they pushed the GSEs into bundling them to mitigate the risk.
SideTraKd	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2033	No one in the private sector wanted to touch that market, originally.
SideTraKd	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2033	It was the GSEs, with their wink and a nod hint that these bundles would be insured by the government against loss, that spurred the initial private investor involvement.The only truth at all to your words is that the private sector and Wall Street investors were deeply involved by the time it all crashed.
SideTraKd	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2033	It had taken a life of it's own in the private markets, leaving the GSEs with less than half of all bundling.But it was government involvement in the markets that got the ball rolling, in the first place.
Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2035	Sometimes Dan seems to have a bit of a tendency to sound like government is always the cause of all problems, and letting the free market operate unfettered is the solution to everything.
Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2035	My point was simply that the mess we find ourselves in was not caused simply by Washington ordering banks and other institutions to make unwise financial decisions.
Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2035	Bad policy decisions in the government certainly played a role, but decisions made in the private sector were a big big factor in causing the recession.Just pointing out there's plenty of blame to go around.
Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2035	Like Alan Greenspan said about the behavior of mortgage lenders, “Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholders’ equity, myself included, are in a state of shocked disbelief.”http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/bu...y/24panel.html
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	Still using the NY Times liberal propaganda machine as a source?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	NYT long ago stopped paying any attention to TRUTH.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	Use better, less biased sources.

Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	VERY NEARLY.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	Yes the private sector did jump in and take FULL advantage of the license to steal that the Govt gave them.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	Should that come as a surprise?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	Had the Govt NOT created the atmosphere and opportunity for near illegal business practices, the private sector would not have BEEN ABLE to take advantage of a situation that did not exist.Being the old fart that I am, I remember the days when bankers were the most cautious business people around.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	The old joke was that to get a loan, you had to prove to the banker that you absolutely did not need the money!If you did not have 20% down and excellent credit and a good and permanent job, RENT.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	Because you would not get a loan.Bankers had no intention of changing their attitudes and practices, the Govt insisted that ALL had a right to own a house whether they could afford it or not.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	As totally stupid as that sounds, our elected representatives actually said such things.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	And REQUIRED that bankers act toward that end.Do you leave your car running with the doors and windows open and the keys in it , parked on a downtown street while you go shopping?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	NO, you don't.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	But that is what the Govt did with the mortgage and financial industries.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	Yes the private sector still had to be dishonest and drive away in the car, so they are not blameless.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	I know myself to be absolutely honest, but I've never been tempted with BILLIONS with no fear of prosecution.
SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2039	Well, that would be one of my problems with Greenspan.
SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2039	Because once the government implied that they would back those bundles against loss, even though it wasn't supposed to be true, it opened the door to full fledged involvement of the markets.
SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2039	Of course, it was reckless, but they were doing what the government wanted them to do.
SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2039	A lot of people saw the problem develop and tried to put a stop to it.
SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2039	Sad that Greenspan was astonished by it all.
SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2039	That self-interest of the lending institutions had the government interest of pushing the sub-prime loans super-imposed on top of it.What really galls me is to see Obama, of all people, wag his finger at the banks, as if he had no personal involvement in the entire mess.
SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2039	And now, we're supposed to forget what started it all, and accept Obama's tired analogy of Republicans driving the car into the ditch.
SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2039	It's quite ridiculous.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	Your logic is completely flawed.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	If not for government, the environment to do these sorts of things would have happened naturally.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	With no restrictions in place, they would have done the same thing.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	Without restriction, a license to steal exists naturally, only curbed by others ability to use force to protect their assets.Government NEVER required banks to do what they did.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	They did it because they were short term thinkers who ignored the long term consequences of their actions, in order to gain the short term benefits.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	That has nothing to do with government, and everything to do with the modern business environment.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	The assumption that underlies most right wing economic thought is that we assume rational actors.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	The reality is, that assumption cannot accurately be made.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	People's actions are far too often irrational to make that assumption.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	The irrationality of the actions of bankers and people taking loans, combined with the artificially low interest rates(an idea advanced by Friedman), created this mess.
frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	So government had a role to play, but to say that very nearly all blame lies with government is beyond absurd.
Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2041	Oh, for crying out loud, Dan, I was only citing the NY Times to source the Greenspan quote, and I only used that because it was the first source Google found for me. Since there's no real dispute about what he said, I didn't feel the need to wade through the minutes of the Congressional hearing he said it at.
Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2041	:PAnd don't you see the irony of accusing the government of encouraging &quot;near illegal business practices&quot; considering that it's only the government's actions that make illegal practices illegal in the first place?
Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2041	Errr, what personal involvement?
Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2041	Obama was strictly a private citizen before Jan 2005, and not involved in the financial sector at all.
Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2041	And while I'm certainly not an expert, I don't recall any important financial legislation going through the Senate between then and Jan 2009.
Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2041	Unless someone can correct me on that?
SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2042	I certainly can.Although many other Senators and Representatives had a much deeper involvement with blocking meaningful reform at the GSEs, Obama himself was one of the top five recipients of funds from the GSEs during his term as Senator.
SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2042	During that time, Senate Bill 190 was released from committee favorably to the floor, but was never brought to debate because the Democrats made it very clear that they were in lockstep opposition to it, and Republicans did not have enough votes to push for it on their own.Obama was one of those Senators.
SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2042	http://www.govtrack.us/users/questio...=bill:s109-190This is the bill that McCain unsuccessfully sought to revive during the election, and Obama refused to do so, even though, by then, the problem was VERY apparent to anyone that was paying attention to it, and had grown far worse even just since the bill was first released from committee.Now, that does nothing to say that Obama was anywhere near as involved as certain others, especially Dodd, who had so much involvement with the housing crash that he literally retired at the end of his term.
SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2042	But Mr. Obama's current rhetoric on the causes of our economic situation simply flies in the face of reality, and he is far more culpable for the situation than he would like anyone to believe.

Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	The evidence that it is happening is absolutely overwhelming at this point, and trying to pretend there's a scientific debate about it is about on a level with the big tobacco execs going before Congress back in the 80's and saying that they didn't believe that their product is addictive or causes disease.If you're thinking of the so called climategate email - the one that said something about finding a trick to hide the decline - I'm afraid you've been bamboozeled.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	That was one email out of more then a thousand, taken completely out of context and given a heaping helping of innuendo.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	Using those methods, you could make almost anyone look like an ax murderer.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	The trick was as in, &quot;Hey, I just learned a great new trick for solving differential equations,&quot; and the general context was a discussion of finding a way to integrate very different kinds of data into a coherent whole.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	Which usually ain't easy, let me tell you.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	The people involved in that email have had their work gone over with a fine toothed comb, and absolutely no wrong doing or data manipulation has been found.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	The worst they were guilty of was griping about having to hand their raw data over to someone they felt would misuse it.And even if you chose not to believe that, you could throw out the entire life's work of those guys and there would still be a mountain of evidence saying that climate change is real and it is happening.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	In some cases literal mountains - alpine glaciers have been retreating dramatically around the world for decades.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	You have the historical climate records of the last century or two, ice cores from Greenland, Antarctica, and alpine glaciers from around the world, tree ring data from around the world, lake and ocean sediment evidence from around the world - all of which point to the exact same thing: CO2 levels in the atmosphere have spiked and temperatures are rising dramatically.The debate now is about how bad the effects are really going to be, and how much we can and should do about it.And even if you still insist on denying climate change, how can you seriously argue that getting off of fossil fuels, particularly oil, is an important and urgent priority?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	Being depending on oil imports form the Middle East has big and obvious political and economic effects.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	And we've hit peak oil - even with improving technology the total amount of oil produced is going to start an inexorable decline from now on.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	That plus the surging demand for oil from rapidly developing parts of the world like India and China...
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	supply and demand, anyone?And before you start saying that the market will take care of it...
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	We've known since the 70's that we need to get off of oil, and what has the private sector done about it?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	Not a thing.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	We've been sitting on our thumbs for decades.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	The Brazilians, for example, have not.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	They decided after the oil shocks of the 70's that they were going to be energy independent, and guess what?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	They are.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	Thanks to determined action, the Brazilian economy mostly runs on home grown sugar cane ethanol - they import virtually no oil at all.Oil prices are going to start going up inexorably from now on, that's just a fact of life.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	If that rise is gradual, sure, then the market will be able to deal with it.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	But what if it's not gradual?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	We saw just a few years ago that prices can spike dramatically in a very short amount of time, even without things like terrorism or international politics getting involved.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	What if oil prices double in a month - for several months in a row?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	Is that a risk worth taking?
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2053	Once again you do it.There are 2 paragraphs highlighted.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2053	You pick the first onlt and then drone on and on with opinion stated as fact.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2053	Your unceasing habit.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2053	You believe Climate Change to be a reality, but no such FACTUAL reality has been proven.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2053	I'm not saying it is not real, I'm very doubtful as climate does fluctuate, but I don't know either way.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2053	But you ignored the second and more important paragraph.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2053	If BHO IS deeply involved in the CCX, then he serves only his bank account when talking about energy bills, not the USA.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	And once again you do it, trying to ignore inconvenient facts by labeling them as opinions.It is a fact that the evidence for anthropogenic climate change is overwhelming, not an opinion, and even cursory research would tell you that.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	And you completely ignore the fact that the real concrete goal of cap and trade is to get us off of fossil fuels.But, since you want me to directly address President Obama's personal involvement in CCX, let's review:
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	Noungrant (plural grants)1.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	The act of granting; a bestowing or conferring; concession; allowance; permission.2.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	The yielding or admission of something in dispute.3.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	The thing or property granted; a gift; a boon.4.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	A transfer of property by deed or writing; especially, au appropriation or conveyance made by the government; as, a grant of land or of money; also, the deed or writing by which the transfer is made.Nounfoundation (plural foundations)4.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	A donation or legacy appropriated to support a charitable institution, and constituting a permanent fund; endowment.5.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	That which is founded, or established by endowment; an endowed institution or charity.You will note the distinct lack of words like &quot;loan&quot; &quot;investment&quot; or &quot;repayment&quot; in these definitions.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	How then does the Joyce Foundation have any financial interest in the worth of CCX?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	And even if they did, how would that financially benefit President Obama?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	Being a former board member does not give him a financial stake in it.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	And even if he did have some sort of investment in it, which I don't think is even possible with a charitable foundation, Obama's assets have been put in a blind trust, like all Presidents.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	So, Dan, I'm afraid your logic fails not once, not twice, but three times.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2055	Naive, to infinity.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2055	CCX is not a charitable foundation.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2056	Nooooo, but the Joyce Foundation is. And you still have three gaps in your argument to bridge.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2057	Not too many take out newspaper adds of their corruption.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2057	They don't want you liberals looking too foolish.

Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2070	Climate change!!!!!!!!!!!Now I'm more than a bit older than you, but still I've been around for well less than a century.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2070	A mere 70 years.In that time I've lived thru:A cold period in a general warming trend.A warming period in a general cooling trend.A very warm period of a general warming trend.A very cold period of a general cooling trend.Stable periods in a generally unstable climate.Unstable periods in a generally stable climate.ALL of the above have been &quot;official&quot; decrees by learned people that study such climatic events.All of the above are not possible in one short lifetime, yet they all have been official proclamations.Now we are told that we have warmed up a small part of A DEGREE since 1900.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2070	Less than one half of one degree warmer now than it was 110 years ago.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2070	In order for that to be true, we must assume that temperature recordings in 1900 were accurate to within less than one half of one degree.
Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2070	So do you BELIEVE that temp recordings 110 years ago were accurate to within 100% to 99.75%I have very serious doubts that they were.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Well, in order to decide what to make of something like changing pronouncements on where the climate is going, it helps to understand a bit about the nature of science.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Science is never absolutely certain, and is never finished.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	The basic premise of science is to admit that neither a researcher or their instruments can ever be perfect - you do the best you can, make an estimate of how close you figure you probably got to the truth, and then leave the best record you can as a guide to the next person to come along and tackle the problem.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	That's true of even the most well established and respected theories in science.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Take the theory of gravity - it doesn't get much more certain then gravity, does it?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	And yet just a few years ago NASA sent up a satellite called Gravity Probe B to try and poke holes in it.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	As far as scientists are concerned, it's a win win - if they can find holes, then they can address them and make the theory better, and if they can't, it increases the confidence they have in the theory.So I'm not really sure what &quot;official pronouncements&quot; you may have heard, but I can guarantee that no peer reviewed article would have made such a claim with absolute certainty.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	In fact, I figure it's more then likely that what you heard wasn't coming from scientists at all; it was probably the news media taking some tentative research and blowing it up to make a good headline.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	You know how people complain that one day scientists say that food X will make you live a hundred years, and the next day they're saying it'll kill you?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	That's not science doing that, that's the media.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	A scientist will say, &quot;Well, after following so many people for so many years who were eating so much of food X, we saw the following outcomes.&quot; Science is in the business of dealing with very complex and hard to understand things, it's in the business of nuance.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	As I think we all know, the news media doesn't much care for complexity or nuance.So, does all this apply to climate change?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Yes.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Are scientists absolutely certain that human caused climate change is happening?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	No.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Could it turn out later that this was all a big mistake, a misinterpretation of faulty data or something?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Absolutely.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Then why should we listen to warnings of climate change?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Because life never gives us certainties, and all we can do is make the best decisions we can with what we have.Generally speaking, science gets better as time goes on.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	What a scientist says today is going to be more reliable then what they were saying yesterday.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Global warming has been a major topic of research for a good thirty years now, and as time goes on, the evidence that it is happening has mounted, and the uncertainties shrunken, until today there is consensus in the scientific community that the evidence overwhelmingly says it is happening.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	It's about as certain as science ever gets about anything.In fact, the uncertainty is now so low that the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) have issued quite literally unprecedented statements about climate change.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	They're saying that climate change is happening, we're the ones doing it, it's going to be bad, and we'd better do something about it.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	The AAAS and NAS have *never* issued a call to action like that before, about anything.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Why should you listen to them?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Because they're the most prestigious, most well respected organizations of the smartest, most well informed, and geekiest people on the planet.

Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	If you're not convinced by what they say, then nothing from science will ever convince you of anything.And it's not just the scientists.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	The Pentagon takes climate change so seriously that they didn't even consider the question of its reality in the February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and went directly to considering how to deal with its effects.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	There's even an organization of major industries called US Climate Action Partnership calling for immediate action on the issue, that includes companies like Alcoa, Ford, GM, Chrysler, GE, Dow and Dupont.

Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2073	All before our present ridiculous &quot;Age of Political Correctness.&quot; Now none open their mouths without &quot;plausible deniability.&quot;The fact that few have the stones to make a statement today, does not mean that it was not commonly done in the past.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	Hey, I'm not saying that scientists aren't just as human as everyone else.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	We all have a bad tendency to overstate our certainty at times, including me. But the basic principles of the scientific method have been firmly established for centuries.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	And there's a big difference between what a scientist may say in casual conversation, or even when being interviewed by a reporter, and what they put in their formal articles for peer reviewed publications.There is no such thing as absolute certainty, ever.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	None of us are infallible, and we all believe things now that will later turn out to be wrong.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	You me, everyone.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	And science is in the business of not only being aware of that inherent uncertainty in life, but to actually quantify it.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	And the uncertainty we have in the reality of climate change is now really really small.
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	I mean, think about it - is the Pentagon in the habit of chasing after the latest intellectual fad?
Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	If the military takes climate change seriously enough to devote significant resources to planning for its effects, don't you think that maybe you should take it seriously too?

Dan40	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2108	Turns out he is different from Bush.
Dan40	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2108	He's worse than Bush.This far out from the 2008 election, NOBODY had ever heard of BHO except his puppetmasters.
Dan40	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2108	So between now and the 2012 elections a dozen or more candidates can appear in the limelight.
Dan40	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2108	And if the obamalama continues to do as rotten as job as he has,,,,,,,,,half those new candidates could be liberal Democrats.

Plymouth	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2141	Roosevelt was thirsting for war, and did everything in his power to provoke it (as the Congress was staunchly isolationist).
Plymouth	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2141	To quote the United States General Hugh Johnson: &quot;I know of no well informed Washington observer who isn't convinced that, if Mr. Roosevelt is elected (in 1940), he will drag us into war at the first opportunity, and that, if none presents itself, he will make one.&quot;He wasn't so concerned with Japan, but rather Hitler and seized upon the opportunity the Axis' tripartite agreement afforded.

Plymouth	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2141	So he had to settle for oil embargos (which I fully support, by the way, but that's neither here nor there).No one is going to be attacking America, a nation of over 300 million people and the size of the European continent, a nation which has the strongest army, airforce, and navy every known, the nation that hosts the UN and the worlds financial headquarters.

Plymouth	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2146	We cut off their oil supplies.I'm not denying any of this occurred.

Plymouth	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2146	What I am saying, however, is that our involvement in WWII was not because the rest of the world thought we were &quot;pansies.&quot; It would be analogous to somebody attacking an even better armed China, the rising military and economic power of the time, on the virtue of them being perceived as &quot;weak.&quot; Obviously no sentiments like that exist today; such was the case in 1938 as well.
Plymouth	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2146	To suggest otherwise is ludicrous.

RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2169	I was using the dual slit experiment as an analogy.
RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2169	The analogy demonstrated that we can know to a degree of probability which slit the particle will take.
RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2169	We know these type of probabilities well enough to make calculations and the probabilistic outcome of these calculations are accurate enough to design circuits.
RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2169	just as I pointed out.
RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2169	Nevertheless, even though we know with an exceedingly high degree which slit the particle will take there is still a chance that the particle will do the unexpected and take the slit that it 'shouldn't' according to the rules of probability.
RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2169	The circuit may fail if that happens.
RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2169	That's bad for circuits but good for people because that tiny fractional lee way is the room we require for free will to exist.
RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2169	That is because if God knew with an accuracy of 100% exactly the future and what choices we would make our free will would not, and could not exist.

MegadethFan	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2194	Socialism requires some fundamental and core ideas, namely communal ownership of the 'means of production', which Obama has not slightly indicated moving to.

RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	Allow me another ?; I do mean to, and usually do say that unless an wayward Freudian slip encroaches upon my published internet font, my verbiage and other presentations will proclaim that Obama merely cleaves heavily to all things socialist, and often adopts those things which is far more dangerous than even a military solution in some cases.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	The issue isn't not how much he spent but rather the way he spends our money.

RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	I would wager you are wrong about that!
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	I am sure he has contemplated the dream of world wide socialism with the USA being leading the charge down the path to national poverty or worse!
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	World governance is world governance.

RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	It's manifesting as bankrupt economies, bankrupt citizens, hungry people, and other failures which are resulting in civil disobedience, protests in the streets, and social unrest!
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	No you Europeans can keep all that, including the international world court.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	BTW, we are a sovereign nation with a Constitution that grantees our rights and security, additionally that same constitution does not allow other countries to meddle in our affairs.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	Obama is naive that seeks to appease instead of having a spine.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	He would of spooned with Hitler if this was 1938 because that is what his naivety sows, stupidity!
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	Sadly for we citizens, especially those he has duped, he is dumber than rock despite his degree and Ivy League education and that has and will result in untold human misery if he isn't stopped IMO.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	Right now the damage is not that great, however it will soon snowball.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	We have some time to correct Obamas mistakes and it appears with the GOP congress attempting to repeal the so called health care bill (another socialist instrument) that we may save the day yet.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	So, MD, I hope and pray that we will get Obama out of office before anything else bad happens.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	God help us if the poo really hits the fan!
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	No he is not the direct manager IMO, he is the puppet of the people with the real power.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	He (by wielding the power of the USA) may be in the top three fourths in world power, but he is simply a power broker doing the bidding either knowingly or with ignorance of a few people that really has the power to control the economies of nations.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	In fact at least one of these people has said in print that he enjoys destroying national economies (or playing the game that leads up to destroying that nations currency etc).
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	Well, with all due respect the ignorance you speak of is deposited in piles and heaps in your camp.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	Your country exists only because of the power of a pre-Obama USA.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	Yes its the way we roll MD. Sorry, I don't want to be a citizen of the world, nor do I want the USA to be a national citizen of the world.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	I want the world to leave me and our nation alone and would hope that the next president has the wisdom to help us achieve that isolationism which will allow us to last a thousand years.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	If we instead kiss the UNs butt and reelect Obama or a clone of Obama the USA will cease to exist in less than 50 years IMO.Look personally I will survive (in all likelihood).
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	However, I would rather survive in a world where the USA exists in name and in SPIRIT.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	The reason for that is because I love my fellow man as myself.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	I desperately love the children who will pay the real price of living and most likely suffering in a world without the USA and other freedom loving nations.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	I for one don't want to find out, nor do I want my fellow man to discover what that little shop of horrors will (or may) be like either.

RevAnarchist	merc	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2197	I am no different and I hate to admit it!
RevAnarchist	merc	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2197	When I lived in AK in the late 80's I was making $36 dollars an hour tax free with a $200 a week for housing as a journeyman iron-worker and going to school at the University of AK for free at night (VA bill, earning credits for my C. Theology MA).
RevAnarchist	merc	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2197	I had subcontracted the structural and reinforcing steel in a pedestrian walkway on a steel bridge that towered near 200ft over the bay, but they paid me by the hour because I had so miserably underestimated the bid.

RevAnarchist	merc	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2197	So most ten hour days I made 360 dollars plus around 50 dollars to eat on and help defer the cost of a room, or about 1600 tax free dollars per four day work week.
RevAnarchist	merc	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2197	Anything over 40 paid double wages rather than time and a half which was common in the states!
RevAnarchist	merc	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2197	I was married.
RevAnarchist	merc	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2197	My wife was an E-6 and she earned about half what I did plus she got housing etc. and we bought groceries in the PX.

RevAnarchist	merc	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2197	In the 80's it was about 10-12 bucks an hour.
RevAnarchist	merc	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2197	Anyway what I am saying is that we are too comfortable.
RevAnarchist	merc	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2197	The trouble is that what happens here usually happens in the rest of the states in a few years and one cant buy a job here.
RevAnarchist	merc	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2197	I owned a small testing lab and had to sell it because not enough people was testing soil and I lost a state contract for testing bodily fluids for DUI cases etc. So about three years ago I sold the lab and used the modest profits to throw myself in the church and two Christian humanitarian non profits I founded.
RevAnarchist	merc	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2197	I broke even the first year then the bottom dropped out when the economy tanked.

flounder	Political Guardian	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2231	I think with Obama if he did not learn it in a book he's stumped, and he has that Chicago approach to politics.Now if Obama steps down for the good of the party that would be different, but for a Democrat to challenge him,,,that would be out In my opinion...Even though I am conservative, I think it's a shame if Clinton never gets a chance to run again.
flounder	Political Guardian	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2231	She is one of the few Democratic Icons left...How the Democrats took Obama over her I will never understand,,,ever.Personally I think it was a set up...Lets face it they were never going to go with Edwards, they knew about the affair, and then when Edwards backed Obama it was pretty clear what was planned.

RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	Lately he is trying to be more conservative, and he did not do all the harmful leftist things he promised his supporters.

RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	Still Obama is one of our most dangerous presidents and not the Icon that the majority of USA citizens beleive.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	My biggest concern is does our president know that he is harming and has harmed us?
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	Or does he beleive that we should really start down the slippery slope to one-worldism, and national socialism?
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	If the latter be true, then is is worse than our most dangerous president in history, ie Abraham Lincoln.

RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2240	So even if a former ally were attacked that would not be a reason to join in the fight.
RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2240	Only demonstrable events of national self defense would warrant an act of war.

RevAnarchist	SableRay	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2271	Back in the day the PsyOps field operations were brutal and less sophisticated than today, no one raised a fuss over torture, only massacres, and they had to be rather large to get in trouble over.
RevAnarchist	SableRay	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2271	Anyway, I have always maintained that she could have had the nomination if she had played her cards right.
RevAnarchist	SableRay	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2271	Now, as of today with her latest slip of the tongue, it will take a good PR team and her not making more blunders if she wishes to run for presidential office in her lifetime.
RevAnarchist	SableRay	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2271	Personally, I don't think she is interested.
RevAnarchist	SableRay	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2271	Even with a professional PR team, I bet it would take eight years to undo the smears and character assassination levied against here by the media and other enemies.
RevAnarchist	SableRay	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2271	If I were her I would give the world the finger and move to the bush where she could get a respite from the goons that hound her.ra

driller80545	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2272	Honesty, individual liberty, sound money, no entangling alliances foriegn policy.

Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2273	..Interesting that your &quot;mission&quot; was to inform families how to &quot;access federal aid and describe what programs and resources they were eligible for.&quot; Isn't that a contradiction to your &quot;conservative&quot; ideas, especially if you would like to see Ron Paul win the Presidency?
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2273	Philosophy is: If you are Libertarian, you cannot -- repeat, &quot;cannot&quot; believe or want government to help anyone at anytime!

Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2273	Not the poor.

Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2273	Course we have to pay our soldiers to do that, which in point of fact, means they are mercenaries!
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2273	I agree with this statement except to point out that women of any color, religion, social/economic status have been the victims of a dominate, power hungry, economic male society for millennia.

driller80545	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2274	I suppose that if I wanted to help a person with college expenses or single mothers with income, or help support someone otherwise incapable of supporting themselves, I would like the opportunity to pick and choose who and how I do it rather than send my money to Washington and have them pick and choose.

Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2275	Just some comments about the &quot;efficiency&quot; of Medicare and Medicaid.1.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2275	Those programs can only exist because they 'float' on top of a strong, for profit' health care system.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2275	Without that strong underlying system the under reimbursing Medicare/Medicaid programs would collapse.2.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2275	How is the &quot;efficiency&quot; achieved?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2275	It is achieved by contracting out to INSURANCE COMPANIES, the total day to day administration of Medicare/Medicaid claims.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2275	Govt workers are NOT the ones doing the work.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	Correct!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	Every working person has a SS account and pays premiums into that account until retirement.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	It is labeled a &quot;trust&quot; fund, but it isn't.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	If Congress did not &quot;raid&quot; that &quot;trust&quot; in order to pay for items called &quot;discretionary,&quot; like Bratboy Bush's Republican Congress passing &quot;supplemental&quot; bills to fund the 2 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, SS and Medicare would be in the black for not just the baby boomers but their grand children.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	Correct again, which clearly SHOWS THAT MEDICARE IS NOT GOVERNMENT RUN OR A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER!!!!!!!!!!!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	The Administration of Medicare is a &quot;bid&quot; contract just like every other government contract; EXCEPT for example in the case of a Bratboy Bush campaign donor or crony (aka Dick Cheney) like Halliburton and Blackwater.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	(Aside, off topic)Want to view some fact filled info that is sorely lacking on today's media, I recommend viewing, online, last night's Frontline broadcast, &quot;Are We Safer; Flying Cheaper; The Spy Who Quit.&quot; Just for the &quot;fraidy cat&quot; conservatives who are all too willing to sacrifice their &quot;rights&quot; for the old adage, &quot;We can't be too safe.&quot; Further note: I totally disagree with the Afghan Intelligence Head who quit because he wants Americans to stay in Afghanistan to win their war for them.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	If the Afghans want democracy, they will have to be willing to fight and sacrifice for it themselves.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	It is NOT the job of Americans to fight for democracy anywhere but here on our own soil.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	First you say, and I quote: &quot;The medicare program is one of the most efficient programs in history, even if one compares it to &quot;private&quot; business.&quot;Then you agree with me that it is efficient BECAUSE it is done by PRIVATE INSURANCE companies.And then you go off on a Bush Cheney rant about spending.Do you know the worst spending of the Bush era came after Jan 2007?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	It is a fact!
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	Jan 2007 is when the Democrats took TOTAL control of both the House and the Senate.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	With that spending included, the EIGHT YEARS under Bush saw our national debt increase by $5 TRILLION dollars.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	You want to say that is AWFUL and I will totally agree with you.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	Now I say that in just TWO YEARS under the obamalama our national debt has increased by $4 TRILLION dollars.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	I'm old and not up on 'the new math,' so you tell me which is worse.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	$5 TRILLION over EIGHT YEARS [$625 Billion per year average], or $4 TRILLION over 2 years?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	[$2 TRILLION per year average]But we are in agreement that politicians of both parties have raided the &quot;trust funds&quot; with regularity and impunity.

Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	Not at all.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	Just because a private company gets the contract doesn't make it &quot;more efficient.&quot; The government sets the guidelines for the product and the company who wins the contract.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	It is proved time and time again that &quot;waste&quot; in government contracts is propagated thru &quot;loopholes&quot; (which I showed in an earlier post how lack of oversight can cost millions).
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	Why is that?
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	Mostly because there aren't sufficient people in the bureaucracy to check every figure on the invoice, especially, if there's a loophole not covered in the contract.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	There is fraud in Medicare because, e.g. a doctor commits fraud by using medicare accounts for procedures not done without the patient's knowledge.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	The point I wanted to make about Bush/Cheney is that the money used for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars was NEVER included in the Budget.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	NEVER!!!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	The wars were (note I say, &quot;WERE&quot;) paid for by supplemental appropriations passed by Congress.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	Those bills are still being paid for in the national debt.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	I don't have time to &quot;check&quot; your figures and unless you can give me an &quot;unbiased&quot; source for them, excuse me, if I doubt the figures you quote are accurate or realistic.Yes, we do agree about the raid on the SS trust fund.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	It is shameful.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	Now you neoconservatives want to repeal it, taking away from people the promise of dignity in old age they have paid for in a lifetime of work.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	IOW, they will NOT be getting what they paid for.

Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2285	Or do you wish to argue that too?The simple net answers are:Bush WAS bad.

Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2288	One way that could be helped is increase the amount of Legal immigrants allowed per year.
Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2288	It would decrease the lines to get in and would make it easier to come legally, possibly causing those who come illegally to consider doing it the right way...
Hijothis	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2289	If not the best...
flounder	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2290	That does not sound bad, however I doubt it would slow illegal immigration and all you would do is add to the numbers.

Sassy	Cicero1964	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2291	The dollar value today is NOT the value it was 50 years ago.

Giftedone	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2292	That spending was in the bag before Obama stepped in and it had to be done.

Giftedone	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2292	but neither the fire... nor the fact that the ship is still floating has anything to do with Obama or the democrats..

Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	If you care to go and find the statistics, the 2 wars are not that large a percentage of our spending.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	Military spending is a large part, but not the &quot;2 wars.&quot; And you are an out and out liberal, NOT an independent.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	If it looks like a liberal, and it talks like a liberal, and it thinks like a liberal, and it smells like a liberal, its a liberal.And, remember, Obama inherited the Bush spending debt, including TARP, 2 wars and the &quot;donut hole.&quot;As I pointed out to you earlier, the largest spending AND increase in our debt in the Bush Presidency was after Jan 2007 when Democrats took TOTAL control of all of Congress.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	Spending and debt increase tripled Bush's previous 6 year average under the Democrat control.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	And it was a Democrat Congress that passed TARP.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	Bush's blame is in signing it.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	Same as obamalama's blame is in signing $4 trillion in debt increase by signing the Democrat's bills.The national debt increased by $5 trillion dollars in 8 years under Bush.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	60% of that increase occurred in years 1 through 6 with a Republican Congress.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	40% of the increase occurred in years 7 and 8 under a Democratic Congress.As I constantly point out to your die hard liberal convictions, Bush WAS bad.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	BHO is many TIMES Worse.You projected an increase in the debt over $6 trillion in obamalama's FIRST [and please, please, please, ONLY] term.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	A TRILLION MORE than Bush in HALF the time.WHAT more do you need to know?
Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2294	I agree.
Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2294	It would lessen the frustration of the legals, but you are right, it would most likely no decrease the amounts of illegals.
Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2294	And the fact that we make it so appetizing is 100% correct.
Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2294	We give them everything free and let them &quot;anchor&quot; babies.The Fair Tax nails 'em though...
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	You are to label me a &quot;liberal.&quot; I am NOT!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	You haven't any evidence of that other than I DISAGREE with you!!!!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	Fact is, at one time in my youth, I was a Republican precinct captain, and most of the folk there tended to call me a &quot;conservative.&quot; But when Reagan arrived on the scene, that was when I turned Independent and have been ever since.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	IMO, you are the one that smells!!!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	with your inability to provide sources for your radical statements.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	You are just like every other neoconservative, fiscally irresponsible when it comes to &quot;spending&quot; other people's money and then whine and blubber (like NeoSpeaker Boehner) about the deficit and debt.And, remember, Obama inherited the Bush spending debt, including TARP, 2 wars and the &quot;donut hole.&quot;
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	Your &quot;unbiased&quot; sources that actually quote these figures!!!!!!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	It's NOT my job to confirm your figures.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	It's your JOB to do that!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	I am not your to help you prove your argument.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	I did find this (please note I DO PROVIDE AN UNBIASED SOURCE):
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2297	Since you won't accept the Us Dept of the Treasury as a source which you have a link to examine their figures, go ahead and use ANY excuse you wish to use.From the US TreasuryUS national debt at 3 months prior to obamalama's inauguration:09/30/2008 $10,024,724,896,912.49 US national debt today: $14,071,897,000,000.Difference $4 TRILLION, 47 BILLION.Th wars were &quot;off Budget&quot; by Bush?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2297	That's your argument.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2297	That is hilarious since EVERYTHING is &quot;off budget&quot; by the grossly incompetent, world wide laughing stock, clown, obamalama since he does NOT have a budget yet!!!
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2298	You further need to note that our national debt is stated in US dollars because it is OUR national debt.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2298	It is not in dollars vs. any other currency.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2298	WE owe China $1 Trillion United States Dollars, we do not owe them or anyone else the equivalent of a trillion dollars in their money.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2298	So the international value of the dollar does not effect our national debt.What can effect our national debt is our own INFLATION.And according to the Democrats in power since Jan 2007 until this month, there has been no inflation.Since 2008, [Bush's time] until now, according to our Govt.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2298	there has been no inflation, so that those receiving Govt paychecks with a COLA factor, have not received any increase since 2008.So our national debt today is the same as if it were stated in 2008 dollars.So go ahead and claim that the National debt clock site is biased, go ahead and claim that the US Treasury is biased, and go ahead and claim that its all inflation.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2298	Go ahead and keep your eyes and mind firmly closed to the indisputable FACT that the gross clown obamalama has blown $4 TRILLION Dollars in 2 years and we have no robust economy, and no low unemployment, and no booming housing market to show for the absolute WASTE of $4 Trillion Dollars.He blames the greed of Wall Street and the banks for our financial woes and then defends bailing out those same Wall Street firms and banks.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2298	He blames Insurance companies for the unaffordability of health care and then champions a bill that VASTLY expands insurance companies markets!Now he is claiming to be more business friendly and hires the CEO of GE.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2298	The company that finances the obamalama propaganda and advertising networks of NBC and MSNBC.I'd vote for a derelict living in a packing crate before I'd vote for the idiot we have in DC now.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	I repeat: Figures don't lie!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	But, Liars can figure.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	Everything you post shows your contempt for ANY government, including those YOU did and do vote for.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	Let me ask you this: What or where would you be without government?
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	Probably dead or suffering because the older you are, the weaker you are.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	Even extraordinary wealth or the amount of health care you can purchase will not protect you from physical disability, disease, poor care or public disinterest.I repeat: Conservatives are &quot;Fraidy Cats&quot; and you are.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	You are as terrified of those who do not pose a threat as you are of those who do.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	You think government is out to &quot;get you.&quot; In stead, you place your trust in free trade, the WTO, corporate greed and -- this is true irony -- in an amoral political party that propagates its self interest and survival over the moral imperative intrinsic in the Constitution: Equal protection under the law, human dignity and freedom from human misery.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	That's exactly what I thought you would do/have done, and that &quot;idiot&quot; would still have more concern for your well being than any neoconservative pundit, congressperson, evil-spirited Republican moron that spouts lies over facts, reveres dollars over human beings and global corporations over governments!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	PS: You still haven't provided a &quot;source&quot; for your rhetoric.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	Anyone can twist figures from any source and make them &quot;work&quot; for an imprecise conclusion.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	There are more factors in the simplistic &quot;debt&quot; numbers you use that &quot;mitigate&quot; the outcome you insist upon -- as is clearly demonstrated in the source I quoted.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	But, people with closed minds to anything other than their personal dogma are incapable of understanding that, even when it is an intrinsic point in the argument!
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2300	You claim to be an independent not a liberal.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2300	Yet faced with indisputable facts you fall back on the stereotypical liberal ploy of insulting the intelligence of ANY that disagree with your closed minded opinions.The debt numbers are accurate, not put up by any left or right political propagandist.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2300	Your inability to see the truth is your own burden to bear, not mine to share.

RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	I founded and own the missions and the church, but now they are owned by our members who now have a vested interest in participating in a religious community as well as a spiritual one!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	Both missions (Mountain Manna Mission, ie MMM and Mission of the Crosses ie MOTA) are christian humanitarian missions with the bulk of our mission going to assist clients with basic needs.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	The church supports both with a 501c status which we use as a tax shelter etc. The members of the church ie Apocalyptic Bearer Of The Cross Church, A.B.O.T.C.C. actually own stock in the church and missions.This is all public record in Carter County Court house in Carter County TN.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	Yes, a huge mega contradiction, kind of.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	It’s true I am a libertarian and lean conservative concerning most issues, but people are more complicated than labels that most people employ to ID or describe others.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	I am no this or that but a blend of this and that, as most of us are.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	I resist socialism in most cases.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	I don’t want to see a black (white or green) third generation welfare mom ruining her life and the lives of her fourth generation welfare children.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	However due to mans inability to govern man, we have poverty, which produces citizens that are unable to earn enough money to pay for basic humanitarian needs.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	In those cases we should use government assistance.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	Read the above.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	With all due respect, trust me I was haunting the halls of the campus buildings* long before you were, I suspect.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	* MA, comparative religion/theology
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	Yes, we have opened Pandora’s Box and beheld a brave new world that sprang out and engulfed us in a big bang of modernism before we could close the (*)(*)(*)(*) thing.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	The problem is that our species have not learned how to live in a society that does not need dominate, power hungry, economic males, so there is a square peg of those males trying to fit in the round hole of a modern world.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	In fact, if you could imagine a vast landscape of trillions of different shaped pegs trying to fit in trillions of different shaped holes, you would be imagining the modern world as I see it.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	The pegs and holes are an analogy for the outdated and obsolete ideas and things in our world, trying to fit in reality of the modern world, represented analogically as the holes.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	Don’t fret, most of those nasty males have been dying off and bequeathing their wealth to their surviving widows, giving them the power that they crave.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	As the baby boomers age and die, that process will accelerate for better or worse.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	Good for you, I understand your anger.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	Sorry you had issues, I had some as well, which helps me understand.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	If you are speaking about Obama’s toxic health care bill/tax , it has too many problems.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	The first is the mandatory requirement.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	I am not opposed to a health care system subsidized by the government if done right.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	Obama’s Health care folly is an example of how NOT to create a health care system.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	I don’t really want to discuss Medicare etc. except to say it could have been self sufficient, and that is the prime requirement, fiscal balance.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	First I am of the opinion that due to the very effective character assassination by the media, as well as by her own faults of not being PC I wouldn’t want her to run for president until some time has passed say, eight years.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	If I were her handler, I would have her stop making blunders* and comments that are non PC.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	Then I would groom her, for eight years, I guarantee at the end of that period she would sweep the election if conditions were as ‘anti Democrats’ as it is now.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	She is an highly intelligent woman (with an IQ that was estimated at 116.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	Yes there was a fabricated fraud IQ test that indicated a score in the 80s and it has been making the internet rounds but it is fake and not validated).
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	She has impeccable moral and ethical standards, so I believe she would make a great president.*(Blunders when viewed as someone running for president, she has made no ethical or moral blunders I am aware of)
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	That statement is simply twaddle . She can be just as easily be indicted as a citizen as governor and we are still innocent until proven guilty, like it or not.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	She elected to quit the governorship to pursue a higher political office.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	Not to mention that she was giving up a job that 99% of us would kill for!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	So she actually made a personal sacrifice by giving up her desirable Governess position!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	too long text 12,000 words to be cont.

RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	Yes, what a highly noble idea, ie to make money so her estate can care for the child, instead of becoming a burden on the state.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	You see ms. Sassy many liberals would have aborted her challenged child for their own convenience.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	Ah’ killing an unborn for purely selfish reasons is nothing to cherish and be admired for.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	No, those kinds of abortions are a natural crime called murder, and are beyond reprehensible.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	In contrast to a liberal pro death politico would do i.e. ; (abort for convenience) , what Palin did by keeping the child which she knew would need a lifetime of care is so unselfish and beautiful, so morally and ethically correct, I would voted for her nearly for that reason alone!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	And your ramblings and *cof* opinions are?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	Well wake up call!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	You are doing the very things you claim that the members here are doing.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	Additionally, I would plead that you avoid making any derogatory claims about who possess common sense and who doesn’t! Again you may be accused of the same thing (lack of common sense) and it is too subjective a claim.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	For example; Many may think that you are a radical feminist holding a long festering grudge against white protestant males hoping to harm them by making hysterical and transparent claims where you focus that long festering beam of your rage in a blanket fashion ensnaring all those that claim any tidbit of libertarianism ? Hmm’ allow this libertarianism infected white Christian male to extend an even more repulsive (to many extremely extreme liberals) a bit of scriptural advice?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	; Matthew 7:5 Hypocrite, first take the beam out of your own eye“ That is not just religious its practical information as well, we all would be better people if we studied and placed it in practice.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	Yes most of those sources have something to sell are not accurate and many are fraudulent.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	I love the net but the material at the library are much better referenced validated and complete.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	I do agree that the Godless secular school system has failed us, and its time to take our schools back from the liberal secular progressives.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	They have nearly destroyed our school system and harmed untold millions of students by spewing their doctrine.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	But that's material for another thread.Even we disagree nearly entirely I am happy to meet you and look forward to more productive debate ~~rr~

RevAnarchist	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2308	I have not always been so anti Obama.
RevAnarchist	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2308	True, I have never been a cheerleader for him.
RevAnarchist	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2308	Nevertheless, by the time he had won I had a quasi optimistic attitude that maybe he would be good for the country, despite some very large concerns over whom he may appoint for the SCOTUS, and other very important issues such as his record on late term abortion and abortion in general.
RevAnarchist	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2308	Too bad he not only did not measure up his polices have brought the USA to the brink of collapse, in my opinion.

Dan40	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2310	Had you said that liberalism is not supposed to be like communism, I would agree with you.But liberalism today has been prostituted into communism.'Splain to me, in your unlimited wisdom, the difference in these 2 philosophies.Communism: From each according to his ability, to each according to his need!Liberalism: Redistribute the wealth.Both are saying, TAKE from those who have earned it, and GIVE it to those who haven't earned it.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2311	The difference is huge.Communism takes *everything* primarily for the benefit of the state which redistributes equally.Liberals say that the quid pro quo of the benefits of capitalism is that you share *some* of the fabulous wealth you are allowed to generate and accumulate to provide safety nets for those who for don't have the market value for basic needs.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2311	It's always surprising to me how many conservatives don't understand basic economic concepts.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2312	I would and have said that all governments are evil by default, and by the degrees of evil.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2312	The reason I say that is because to be a government the government must govern i.e. control its citizens.
RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2312	I would go on but my basset hound, bogie is trying to snif out a place to pee and he has found my ankles....~rr~
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2314	Sure.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2314	I've never said that.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2314	Can't rebut a strawman.

Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	I recovered quickly from my sense of &quot;injustice,&quot; not anger per se, and wrote a recommendation for my competitor, whom I knew and liked.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	Today, she is a licensed therapist.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	My sense of injustice goes to the social hypocrisy that I had a man to pay my tuition when she did not.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	In an ideal world.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	But, life is not a mathematic or ethical equation and never will be.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	So, why throw the baby out with the bath water?
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	It would seem from the polls and the pundits that no one was satisfied with the bill that passed.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	BUT, if you agree that the government CAN handle national health care -- which it has done successfully in Medicare and Veterans Health Care for decades -- then why not a public option that puts a net over the insurance industry to &quot;play fair?&quot; Plus, if Income Tax and SS is mandatory, why is health care not Constitutional?
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	Especially, if it is designed for the public good?
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	It collects from all who receive &quot;income,&quot; not just for those who can afford out-of-control premiums.

Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	She isn't Joan of Arc or Mother Theresa.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	She's an opportunistic fraud.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	Every action she's taken is a prime example of self centered wealth based ambition.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	Some people can be self-educated, but she doesn't even read the newspapers.

Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	This is a conclusion solely based on your Christian ideology.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	Yes, Palin, at this point in time can well afford to care for her disabled child.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	But, she isn't &quot;relying on the Lord&quot; to provide care as most of those of the Christian faith expect a woman to do.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	Anti-abortion advocates will encourage and even aid her to her decision to birth the baby, but she's on her own after that.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	Hardly the &quot;Christian&quot; thing to do.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	Nor are they willing to &quot;adopt&quot; that child to raise it, educate it until it is able to survive on its own.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	No, they let &quot;government&quot; do that.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	! Isn't this a case of the pot calling the kettle black?
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	May I suggest you honor your own judgment applied to me.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	I agree, &quot;some&quot; libraries are better than others.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	That's true of the sources on the internet as well.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	But, anyone who can use a computer can save time by using it and the internet to research and learn.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	It is a tool.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	It can be a weapon.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	Like most man made tools, it best used with caution, reason and intelligence.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2328	Care to expand on that statement MD? I am speaking of the last sentence.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2328	~rr~ Perhaps he will answer from his/her understanding, but I've heard this before where Neoconservatism can be summed up pretty much as follows: Borrow and spend because deficits don't matter!
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2329	Once again for your total enjoyment&quot;From the first day of George Washington's Presidency through the last day of Bill Clinton's Presidency, we racked up a total of $5 TRILLION Dollars of national debt.THAT was too much spending!Then George Bush took over, and increased the national debt from the $5 TRILLION left by Clinton, to $10 TRILLION at the end of Bush's 8 years.Bush, in only 8 years, equaled the total OVERspending by all Presidents before him.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2329	That is terrible.Then the obamalama comes in in Jan 2009 with a national debt of $10 TRILLION.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2329	Now its Jan 2011, TWO YEARS LATER, and the national debt stands at $14 TRILLION.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2329	In only 2 years he has equaled 80% of the awful amount Bush spent, and also equaled 80% of all Presidents combined from Clinton back to Washington.The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] projects our national debt will be $18 TRILLION at the end of 2015.Not FOX, not Republicans, but the CBO.And the CBO is projecting their number because of &quot;proposed&quot; spending reductions.The mathematical projection at today's rate of spending is $22 TRILLION of national debt by the end of 2015.$22,000,000,000,000.002015And what did the obamalama choose to talk about the most in his State of the Union campaign speech?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2329	'Investments!'
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2329	That means MORE Govt spending, when we have only a little less than $00.60 cents for every dollar we are spending.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2329	Meaning, every dollar we spend, we have to borrow a bit over $00.40 cents.How hard could it be to find ANYONE that can do better than this incompetent clown?
RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	I am happy you spread the blame where it belongs, this is not a partisan issue, its an survival issue!
RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	That said, isn't the debt terrifying?
RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	I mean its absoultely horrifying!
RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	Some or maybe many of my virtual and regular friends think I am a bit eccentric as I build my new home/office to double as a 'bug out' shelter* of sorts.
RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	The building (Church and mission offices) and despite is fully off the grid capable, self sufficient in electrical power, including heating and cooling and can support two adults for over a year without restocking.
RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	I am not a nut but rather simply endowed with the inability to stick my head in the sand, and perhaps more important I am blessed with a normal dose of common sense.
RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	It's obvious me that we can not sustain anywhere near the level of spending that we seem to think is normal!
RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	I would urge everyone get prepared with a survival plan and options should the worst happen.

RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2332	Yes I agree.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2332	BTW I will reply to your rebuttal ASAP.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2332	I need a coupld hours to nod~rr~
RevAnarchist	Sassy;	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Hi Sassy, I didn't have time to edit this thing for grammar so I hope its Legible ! I am so very aware of that falsehood and its simply paranoia often and, with all due respect it&#8217;s a rank falsehood.
RevAnarchist	Sassy;	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	I have heard it so often I know where you are going with this.
RevAnarchist	Sassy;	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Even if the recipients of theistic giving receives a huge dose of religion with the goodies, they still definitely are getting assistance etc! Your logic is so fallible in that statement that I nearly didn&#8217;t read the rest of your reply, except to give it a cursory glance and dumbed down reply.
RevAnarchist	Sassy;	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	However I took a chance that you were not being totally malicious and decided to give your reply the benefit of the doubt and I am happy I did, because you made some good points.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Well most school children know that Christian missionaries are umm&#8217; &#8230;.Christian missionaries!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	It&#8217;s not like they are going to get ambushed, or given small pox infected blankets along with a what would Jesus do/ love your fellow man tract!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	That is such a repetitively harped message it would be comical Sassy!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	If I offer assistance by my missions yes you may exposed to some awful things including but not limited seeing a bible on my desk or a bit of scripture on the walls.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	You may even be asked to come to church, however you wont be bushwhacked from out of the blue!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Anyone that comes to a church knows that they just might be exposed to Jesus stuff!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	The good news is (in addition to scripture) that secular organizations will charge cash for their services or food etc. If you have no cash you will starve or be denied the services.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	However, our clients will not be turned away unless they are a danger to themselves or our staff.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	(when I was up and running).
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Yes indeedy!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Giving stuff away is unprofitable!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	And you are failing again in your logic.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	All taxpayers pay taxes, not just profitable taxpayers, ha ha.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Wrong.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	However I will say that some missions could be seen an endeavor in socialism.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	That&#8217;s a given eh?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	In fact Jesus would be a communist if he were alive today.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	However I already replied to your concerns.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	I said that I am not an libertarian in every respect, I went to pains to point that out.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	I believe that because of a perversion of society which was accomplished by embracing an paradigm of progressive liberalism and by accepting logical positivism (over metaphysics) we are forced to adopt some tenets of socialism.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	The early church was a form of socialism.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	I have never said all socialism is bad have I?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	There is no black and white in anything in this temporal universe, (ie our tangible universe).
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Trust me, everything resides in shades of black and white, nothing is provable to an accuracy of 100% .
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	(that is not a straw man claim but it&#8217;s close due to Godel universes and the beautifully strange way the quantum world behaves due to uncertainty and non-locality etc.)
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	You must know that if you earn a MA in theology you have more semester hours in philosophy than in nearly any other field.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	I have and I do.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	You should not make such claims in a public forum sassy.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Again not all things are black and white.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Personally I think you may should allow yourself to accept anything given freely without guilt and or anger.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	We agree again.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	If we could know 100% of the variables in the precise moment of calculation we could know everything about anything, and not even God can or chooses to know that about this universe.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	And without going off topic its that very concept that God chooses not to know or more likely can not know to an accuracy of 100% all the variables that constitutes the universe that gives our free will.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	You bring up some good points.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Personally, I believe the IRS and many taxes, including the income tax are illegal!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Adding another wrong to the bath water ie Obamas health care baby doll only reinforces bad behavior.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	So I say that yes, we should throw the dead baby doll out with the bath water!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Lastly I should say that having to pay taxes etc isn&#8217;t the same as being forced to buy a PRODUCT.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Other reasons come to mind not the least being that the health care thing may not stand up to constitutional muster!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Well you must understand that when I read her Bio I saw a woman more accomplished that most.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	She is much more accomplished than most of those that criticizes (I should say crucifies her).
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Additionally, I highly admire her moral values ie her Christianity etc. Of course many people would write her off precisely because she is a Christian and is pro life.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Most pro choice do not really understand or believe pro life people and that is a shame, but that in and of itself is another thread (abortion, morals etc) ra
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	You certainly have some queer ideas about Christians Sassy!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Most Christians consider the lord grants our station in life.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Some don't thinking that God will provide only after death but that's not what scripture tells us.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	I think that maybe you ought to brush up on the Christian faith if you plan to debate subjects that deal with theology, particularly Christianity.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Again, you are very wrong about that as well.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	There are more Christian support groups than secular groups, additionally the church would support her at least they would in most cases.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	My church is not a true church, as I do not preach except as in a guest capacity.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	However, the church of my youth has provided for many members that fell upon hard times, as the 'biker' church that I regularly attend.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Ummm' I goggled for Christian free services for mentally handicapped disabled children and received so many hits that I could not fit them on this page.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Therefore, I tried pasting them to a word processor document and received an error message saying the listings exceeded the capability of the WP!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	I guess that rather shoots your claims down.Next I Goggled atheist organizations that offered free services for children etc etc. I could fit all of them on....ummm... on ...ahhh' a matchbook cover!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	You are assuming that the mother does not take the child!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Ha ha in fact you are so off base that I am beginning to wonder what your agenda is. The sad fact of the matter is that I think you really think those claims are true.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	I am astonished that so much disinformation/propaganda exists.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Apparently, successful propaganda has convinced normally intelligent people like yourself that lies are truth.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	I do.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Where have I been the first to come out of the blue and wrongly accuse you of anything?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Well yes you are correct, I use the computer too much simply take my chances.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	So, we can agree on some items, which is a good indicator that we can discuss the issues without the argument or discussion becoming toxic.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	The biggest criticism I have of your replies is that you made quite a few non-sourced and unsubstantiated claims, many which were reworded are old atheist standbys or worse, however even the worst ones haven't damaged your credibility.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	I know that you have criticisms for me as well ! ra
Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	Right now the interest on our debt is at historically and ridiculously low levels.
Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	Lucky for us.
Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	Some EU countries that have gone beyond our own terrible debt levels are now paying OVER 11% on their debt.
Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	While 5% t0 8% would be a more normal interest rate for us to be paying, that is not the present case.
Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	But imagine if we were paying 7% on our debt.
Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	NOT an unusually high rate.7% X $14 TRILLION = $980,000,000,000.00.
Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	$980 billion dollars INTEREST.
Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	More than the Medicare/Medicaid total.
Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	More than the Social Security total.
Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	More than the Defense Dept. total.Even at our very low rate of interest, the interest amount is the single largest expense we have NOW!
Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	While M/M or SS or DD are higher totals, they are covering multiple agencies/depts.
Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	and multiple programs.
Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	Interest is a single line, and already the highest single line.
Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2336	Well you will read a more detailed report, but basically it eliminates the avoidable taxes (well none should be avoidable, but...)The one tax they can't avoid is the Sales tax because they have to buy things.
Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2336	I mean Wal-Mart would be one of the best examples of where they would HAVE to pay taxes.
Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2336	The sales tax would be possibly shockingly high, around 30% if I'm not mistaken (gotta check that) and it would, in theory make up for the other lost taxes.Can't avoid a sales tax or else you have no food, clothes, technology, cosmetics, etc....
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	If one pays taxes, one is deemed &quot;profitable,&quot; because they have income over expenses.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	&quot;Non-profit&quot; means exactly that, &quot;no income over expenses.&quot; If you do, you pay tax or get a &quot;tax credit&quot; that &quot;forgives&quot; the overage up to a certain amount.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	I don't disagree with your posit.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	NO idea is concrete.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	And, that's the very foundation of philosophy.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	What seems to be, just may not be.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	That's also the foundation of scientific theory and why a theory must be replicated over and over before it is justified to be used as a matter of fact.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	Except that &quot;religion&quot; is the basis for the study.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	Why not?
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	Not necessarily &quot;more capable&quot; just &quot;more aware&quot; of how hard it is to grow and bear a child and then lose the life of that child to something that is avoidable.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	Children are the first priority for most women.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	I don't think a majority of men think that way, tho' I'm also sure some do.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	I do not presume to know what god thinks, chooses to know or not know.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	I do take for my personal philosophy the teachings found in the NT.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	I believe the inhumanity of humanity toward humanity is barbaric, founded in a perverted, distorted prime imperative &quot;to survive.&quot; Human beings have the intellectual ability to &quot;see&quot; beyond selfish, egocentric instincts and can reason together to a achieve a &quot;win-win&quot; goal for the public good.
OneThunder	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2340	True that.
OneThunder	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2340	Consumers tax.No taxes on anything else except consumer goods.Have you found any links to support the 30% figure.
OneThunder	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2340	I'd be interested in reading that.
driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	Imagine that all those programs that you pay taxes to support were to become voluntary.
driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	In other words, instead of sending money to the mongrels through threat of prosecution, you decide what programs that you want to support and how much money that you want to send to support them.
driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	The idea being that you are more careful spending your money than politicians are.
driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	The result would be next to no spending by the fed gov outside of defense and a real infusion of your cash locally.
driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	This is a very simplified version of what Ron Paul has been saying for thirty years.

driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	Fair tax, consumer tax, etc. are all just different names for the same thing.
driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	The pols will not turn loose of the money if you don't make them.

driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	You having control of all your income- what a novel idea.
driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	Crazy?
driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	I would like to try it and see.

RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2346	What would happen if we (the USA) said 'no we will not pay our debt off?'
RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2346	And that 'and any attempt to collect payment will result in war!

Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2350	Such a move would require that we immediately cut Federal and State spending by a few TRILLIONS of dollars since we would no longer be able to borrow any money at any rate.Might be worth a try!!!Also would result in recall or impeachment movements since the bulk of our debt is owed to US citizens.
jthorp24	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2352	How about a billy club???

Joey_Sac	driller80545	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2354	The first thing that would go unfunded would be the Department of Defense!
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2355	Not that many are so stupid to think the world is filled with nice people.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2355	A 30 minute study of world history would tell you that the DoD is one of the most vital departments we have.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2355	Many cuts might need to be made, but the DoD is essential to our survival as a country and just as people.

Hijothis	Albert Di Salvo	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2360	That's hard to discern at this point.
driller80545	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2361	True, we must maintain the DoD to defend ourselves.
driller80545	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2361	But what would be the difference in costs of defending the USA versus the American Empire.
driller80545	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2361	The costs would be in international corporate profits ie haliburton!
driller80545	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2361	lol
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	I certainly hope that the American public will not be that incredibly stupid again.And the Republican candidate?
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	This far in advance of the 2008 elections, the obamalama was NOT a Democratic possibility.There is still time for a candidate, not yet considered a possibility, to emerge.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	BHO did.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	And imagine the difference if the obamalama has to run against an actual STRONG candidate, that is neither old nor carrying Bush baggage.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	Whomever was the Democratic Candidate in 2008 was a walkover.

Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	All the other Democrats shot themselves in the foot.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	And McCain was a sacrificial lamb.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	Now the obamalama will have to overcome his OWN failed policies and the most incredible debt ever run up by any president ever.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	He is the one that will be dragging the baggage this coming election.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	And 2 years from now, his bullcrap of the last 2 years will be even more revealed than it is now.

Joey_Sac	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2366	The Tea Party has a good idea about getting government spending under control, (you know I am a Dem).
Joey_Sac	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2366	But, like many I can not join any organization that has racist overtones.I do not believe all Tea Partiers are racist, but the accusation continues to be made, and the Tea Party has not rejected it with vigor.
Joey_Sac	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2366	All it takes is one picture like this, and the Tea Party credibility is gone for a lot of people.So, for those like myself the Tea Party is a write-off.
Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2367	President Obama was elected by a maj...major....majori.
Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2367	He had the most votes!

Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2370	Many things can kill a political party.
Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2370	And yes, the Democrats experienced a set back.
Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2370	Time will show that unloading the &quot;blue Dems&quot; was good because it is easier to target Republicans outside our party than it is to have internal struggle.Fact is the Republican Party does not even have a contender for President.
Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2370	Romney, Palin, Gingrich, Huckaby all favorites of the conservative Republican base.
Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2370	In the end the Republicans will be smart enough not to nominate any of them.If President Obama refused to run we have a plethoria of qualified candidates, Clinton, Biden, Reid, Pelosi, and my favorite new face, Anthony Weiner . Democrats have the end game.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Weinerhttp://www.weiner.house.gov/

onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2373	Quite frankly, I have seen nothing racist.
onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2373	The &quot;Don't tax me Bro&quot; was a take on the line the drunk dude said to a cop, &quot;Don't taze me Bro&quot;.The Tea Party-Racism link is non-existent, and has yet to be proven.
onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2373	There are wackos in every group, but they do not represent the group.

Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	Liberal SOP, play the race card.The photo comes from not just a liberal site but a progressive site.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	A site that demeans the tea party in every way it can.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	And the photo is from 3/2010 OR earlier.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	The various tea party groups have denied racism and then the liberal media delights in calling them liars.However the tea party spoke loud enough for independents to hear in Nov. 2010.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	Liberals cannot hear as they are brainwashed into deafness and blindness.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	But the vast majority of the American public do not suffer from the liberal looniness.And where does the photo originate?
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	AP, NY Times?
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	FOX, CNN?
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	No it originates with the progressive site its posted on.OTHER, supposedly, racist tea party photos have been shown to be STAGED
onalandline	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2378	Even that one is based on the guy that said, &quot;Don't taze me Bro&quot;, to a white police officer.

Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2383	Where were all you guys in 2001, or 2003, when the government was squandering the budget surplus and running up deficits with tax cuts?But I agree Obama has been not aggressive enough on this issue.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2383	With the country coming out of the recession, it was a mistake to cave to Republicans and let the Bush tax cuts run another two years, which will push back any meaningful progress on the deficits.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2383	Obama should also let the Bush tax cuts expire completely, and at a 5-10% surcharge on incomes over $1m to help redress the damage the Bush tax cuts have caused, as well as trim spending.
Hijothis	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2384	Great bit of facts.

Hijothis	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2384	Anyone know how?
Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	Tell you what.
Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	You seem to be having a problem understanding what this thread is about, and my statements.
Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	So I'll dumb it down for you.
Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	The key word here is &quot;PERCEPTION.&quot; The Tea Party is &quot;PERCEIVED&quot; racist by many people who might otherwise be interested in what they have to say.
Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	You want to argue this picture or that picture.
Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	Well, Google &quot;Tea Party, Racist,&quot; you will find no less than 1,980,000 web sites that discuss the problem!
Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	Most would agree that that many web sites on the subject indicates a problem.
Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	Here is a link.
Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;h...83dfe782e20cdc Now are you ready to discuss the obvious problem or racism in the Tea Party, or are you going to continue to ignore the reality?Tea Party leader, Dale Robertson http://www.mediaite.com/online/tea-p...r-n-word-sign/http://www.youtube.com/TheGRAMMYs?feature=tickerIt is really easy to go with Bill Maher on this issue.
Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	The Tea Party has a public relations night mare, and it will bring them down as racist.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	And now I'll dumb it down for you.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	Liberals PERCIEVE everyone that does not kowtow to the liberal line as RACIST.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	Liberals also believe that the American public is stupid and believes the lies liberals tell.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	And the left constantly insults the American public.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	I'm amazed that liberals do not realize that the constant barrage of, &quot;You don't understand.&quot; and, &quot;I didn't explain it well enough.&quot; ARE insults to the public's intelligence.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	And the public DOES understand and liberals explained their position to boredom.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	We know what you're saying and we don't like it and we disagree.What the tea party is is the famous &quot;Silent Majority&quot; no longer being silent.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	The tea party got a lot of people elected in November and WILL get more people elected in 2012.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	Democrats WILL lose control of all of Congress in 2012.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	And the obamalama's phony move to the center will not hold up to scrutiny for 2 years.The reality is that the tea party is effective and liberals are trying everything they can to smear it.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	That's the reality.Another reality is that 99% of our news media is liberal leftist and they print and broadcast nothing but slurs and claims of racism by the tea party.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	All of that ends up on line so it is no surprise that the same junk is repeated 2 million times.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	But a couple of unsubstantiated stories repeated 2 million times is NOT 2 million examples.
Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	Its just a couple of liberal lies repeated ad nauseum.
onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2389	Bill Maher is a misinformed moron.The Tea Party movement is not racist.
onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2389	There are folks from all walks of life in the movement.
onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2389	More folks should be, but I guess liberals like living in a bloated, bureaucratic pipe dream.Racism is always used by liberals when there really is no argument.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2391	That is an assinine statement.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2391	Show me one post of my where I've called someone a RACIST for not kowtowing to the liberal line.I'll dumb it down for you.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2391	Your entire arguments are based on a strawman.

shaker154	j.r.TheWindbag1	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2395	Both sides are too far apart and there is no &quot;middle&quot; candidate so we are forced to choose between a (south park reference) turd sandwich or a (*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)..

jthorp24	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2402	So you can add another vote to the no column...
LittleLiberty	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2403	Why would I vote no?
jthorp24	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2404	Why would you vote yes?
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	Volumes of reasons.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	Here is a few.A housing bubble where billions of dollars were thrown at the problem, unresolved.A financial crisis, same process and results as above.An economy that also had over a trillion dollars thrown at it.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	The economy improves very slowly without a shred of positive proof that the trillion plus dollars poured in have anything to do with the recovery.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	Economies do EVENTUALLY recover on their own.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	We are now in the &quot;eventually&quot; stage.Unemployment at or over 9% for longer than ANY other president in the entire history of the country, WHILE spending more money than any other president in the entire history of the country.National debt at the end of Clinton's last full fiscal year, $5.674 trillion.National debt at the end of Bush's EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE, $10.024 trillion.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	A TERRIBLE increase of $4.35 trillion.Total accumulated national debt from George Washington through George W. Bush's last full fiscal year.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	$10.024 trillion.Total accumulated national debt now after just over TWO YEARS OF the obamalama, $ 14.168 trillion.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	An incredible, insane increase of $ 4.144 trillion in just over TWO YEARS.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	A &quot;mere&quot; $206 billion more added to the debt and the obamalama will surpass Bush's terrible 8 years of spending in WELL UNDER 3 years.That's why to say NO to the idiot incompetent obamalama.He makes Carter, Nixon, and Bush look good by comparison and they all STUNK.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2406	There's lots of evidence it worked great.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2406	The economy stopped tanking at -7% real and is growing for that last year.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2406	The economy stopped losing 700,000 jobs a month and the private sector has created jobs every month for the last year.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2406	The stock market stopped tanking and is up about 90%.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2406	Even unemployment, always a lagging indicator, is improving.Only those invested in failure for political purposes could possibly say that there is no evidence government intervention worked.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2406	Without it in all likelihood we'd be in the third year of a depression.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2407	To quote:&quot;Without it in all likelihood&quot;Was that Freudian or an admission that you don't know?A FACT that both you and I can see is that after blowing TRILLIONS, the economy is still flat.The unemployment is still high.The banks are not lending.Housing foreclosures are still terrible.Is it better for blowing trillions of dollars or worse for doing so.Would it be better had we not blown trillions that we do not have or would it be worse.Neither you nor I can provide factual proof one way or another.Our only example of such reckless spending and massive Government intervention is FDR back in the Depression.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2407	It took 15 years and a World War to pull us out of that.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2407	Was the Depression that bad, or did Government intrusion cause it to last so long?And the obamalama's recession compares with Reagan's, not with the Depression.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2407	Neither Reagan's nor BHO's recession's were their fault so I'm not blaming him for the recession, just the gross mismanagement of it.What we FACTUALLY have as evidence is that we are $ 4,144,000,000,000.00 further in debt than we were.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2407	And housing, finance, and unemployment still awful.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2407	Remember, last summer was TO BE, &quot;The Summer of Recovery,&quot; according to Biden.
Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2407	WHAT recovery?
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	Just look at who is &quot;presenting opinions as facts.&quot; Kessy_Athena: Don't ever apologize to DanNO40 because he hasn't the manners or the common sense to understand that discussion/debate can ever &quot;trump&quot; his &quot;opinions,&quot; even when you quote unimpeachable, unbiased sources.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	I know.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	I've tried.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	He's too old, too retired and too set in his ways to ever be open minded again.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	Yeah, and for the most part they were ALLLLLLLL Republicans who had 6 years to deal with the problems and decided it was more important to start 2 wars and annihilate the treasury because they wanted to monopolize the oil in the ME for their rich, NeoCon cronies.HOW VERY QUICK CONSERVATIVES ARE TO FORGET!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	They just LOVE to change history!!!!!!!!!They gave humongous tax breaks to the rich and most humongous corporations paid/pay NO TAX AT ALL!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	Examples: GE, Bank of America, BP et.al. The oil producers still get subsidies in spite of polluting the Gulf of Mexico where oil still lies 4 inches deep on the floor of the gulf.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	None of it on the floor has been &quot;eaten&quot; by bacteria as promised and as far as anyone of us knows, the bottom of the Gulf is DEAD!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	SO!!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	Why are you still a conservative?
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	Bratboy Bush allowed his Wall Street buddies to do their dirty deals and then handed it over to Obama, who now must &quot;deal&quot; with the white collar multibillionaires who took the middle class to the cleaners by trashing their pension funds with bogus &quot;synthetic&quot; securities.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	Just like the &quot;richies&quot; who invested with Bernie Madoff, the pension funds got greedy and Bush's SEC cronies fired Brookslie Born for blowing the whistle on them.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	Why not?
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	She's just a stupid woman isn't she?
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	And, everybody knows women have no sense for figures except for those she was born with.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	Once again, I agree with you.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	When you quote figures from the CBO (tho' estimated), I take heed.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	However, you conservatives only take heed when the CBO gives you something you agree with.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	But, you're the first to blow &quot;sour&quot; when you don't agree with them.But, then, conservatives are just like Moby Dick, you &quot;blow&quot; hard against hard facts when the wind isn't to your liking!!!
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Thank you for the unrelenting personal attack.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	The sad FACT, not opinion, is that your attack is nearly devoid of any FACTS.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	But loaded with liberal brainwashed opinions.A for instance: The Republicans under Bush, you CANNOT find a post with me defending them.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	However just as the obamalama did not cause the recession, NEITHER did Bush.The financial and housing crises were caused almost equally by politicians of both parties.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Passing some bills that caused the housing bubble and repealing some laws that would have prevented the insane financial manipulations that went on.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	All of your so called synthetic securities can be laid at the feet of politicians of both parties long before Bush got to DC.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	And there is ample evidence that Bush warned about it and made attempts to correct it.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	But entrenched politicians, D &amp; R, would not allow it.So your misguided and historically inaccurate attempt to lay it all off on johnny come lately Republicans is just repeating lies that liberals have taught you to tell.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	The problems were festering before you became aware of politics at all, other than perhaps a subject in a high school curriculum.Republicans are NOT innocent in the causes of today's problems and neither are the Democrats.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	So I do not fault obama for our present crisis, but I fault him for the outrageously expensive and inept way he has &quot;attempted&quot; to fix the problem.Maybe you forget?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	What he did was get the Stimulus bill passed.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Which was SUPPOSED to be for &quot;shovel ready&quot; projects, but we now know it was a state bailout bill.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Political payback, nothing more, but to the tune of a TRILLION dollars.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Once he had 'shoveled' the Stimulus on us, he then IGNORED the economy entirely for going on TWO YEARS, while he exhausted ALL his political capital on passing obamalamacare.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	And with total control of both houses of Congress he had to stoop to bribes, lies, and coercion of his own party to get it passed.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Meanwhile if the bad economy or unemployment was mentioned, he was ready to write a check.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	NOTHING else, just throw more money at the problem until its so buried in money no one can see it anymore.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	National debt, UP $4.144 trillion since Bush's last budget, how much good is that doing for the nation?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Bush increased the debt $4.350 trillion in 8 years and you and all liberals SCREAM the horror of bush over that.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Yet don't even mutter about $4.144 trillion in just over 24 MONTHS.Your credibility with me is $4.144 trillion in arrears.BP and the oil spill?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Now that is Bush's fault too?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Utter, total nonsense.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	It happened on the incompetent obamalama's watch and IF 4 feet of oil [doubtful] is lying on the floor of the Gulf, it is the obamalama's job to see its cleaned up, not Bush.Oil subsidies?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Do you know what they are?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	They are oil depletion allowances because every barrel they pump out of the ground brings the oil company a barrel closer to going out of business.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Ridiculous?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Probably so, but they were not invented by Bush.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	They were around when he was a drunken college kid and before.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Probably in effect when his Dad was a kid.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Before the tax changes in tax law in the 80's I was invested in oil.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	There were excellent LEGAL, tax CREDITS available for owning oil.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	They took those away and I and 10's of thousands of others, liberal and conservative, got out of oil.Do I defend my opinions?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	YES.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Opinions found by experience greater than yours over decades.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	[What you snidely think of as old age] Even as a school age youngster I received a better more balanced education than you poor kids do now with the shambles our schools have become.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	I have risked my life 100% for this country, knowingly put my life on the line.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	And I have willingly risked my life savings, every cent I had.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	You have done neither.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	That does not make me a good person and you not, you could well be a much better person than me. But those all-in risks are educational.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Educational about every aspect of life.Do I call my opinions facts?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	No, I do not.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	I usually say something is a fact when it is. I don't often point out that I'm voicing an opinion, but if someone has to be told that, they wouldn't understand the disclaimer anyway.
onalandline	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2412	To stop the downward spiral this country is currently engaged in.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	And, what do you call this post of yours, Kudos for me?
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	You can't defend Bratboy because he was the most inept President this country has seen in 50 years.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Reagan was an idiot, but even he raised taxes when he saw the country going to hell in a hand basket.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	And, to proclaim that Bush is not responsible for the humongous debt the country has now is trying to swim in now is simply economic blasphemy.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Not so!!!!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Read my post again.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	But, you won't.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	On the other hand, I can't see that the Tea-baggers have a leg to stand on for their ridiculous and unrealistic demands.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	&quot;Bone-head&quot; Boehner, in spite of his years in the House, can't get the procedure rules in the House correct in order to forward his agenda.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Bottom line, he is a bogus excuse for a Speaker: He's &quot;Blubbering Bubba&quot; at the drop of a hint of how he &quot;suffered&quot; to get to where he is today.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	You being a former military man, you must cringe at the very sight of his shameful visage of emotional drainage.

Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Others wore the uniform but did not serve in combat.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Perhaps that's why you feel compelled to brag about your service.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Yeah, he's expected to fix in a bit over 2 years the inept governance that took Bratboy and the NeoCons 8 years to mess up with lies and idiotic decisions.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Even Rummy the Dummy, in his new book, has 'fessed up to the disaster they inflicted on we the people!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Just your opinion and others like you try to make that claim stick, but even if true, he helped the states out of a bind.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Ummmm, now who is making facts from opinion?
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Can't you get anything &quot;right?
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	I posted 4&quot; (that's 4 inches) of oil on the floor of the gulf.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	That's the report from this source: Gulf of Mexico bottom still coated in oil, recovery long way off
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Is this also a &quot;brag&quot; that you got your money out?
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	What has that got to do with the government continuing to pay corporate welfare to oil companies who are making astronomical profits, profits higher that at any other time in history, while Republicans stridently scream about cutting education, Medicare/Medicaid, Social Security, etc. What have conservatives got against the young and the old in this country?
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Why do oil companies rate higher on the scale of human need than human beings?
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Again you presume info about me that you don't &quot;factually&quot; have access to.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	You know little to nothing about me, my education, my age, etc. I venture to suggest that any apolitical reader on this forum who compares my posts to yours would come away with a very different assessment of my education vs. yours, my ability to reason vs. yours, my foundation of &quot;real&quot; facts vs. your opinionated based &quot;facts.&quot;
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	That statement is a &quot;Hoot!&quot;

Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	How does George Bush being a bad president make the incompetent obamalama a good president?One has nothing to do with the other.The only way they COULD be connected is that if Bush had been a good president, then obama would not have been elected.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	Another Republican, any Republican would have been.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	If Bush had been good, the Republicans would not have offered up the sacrificial lamb, McCain.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	They would have run someone else.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	But Bush was bad, thus opening the door for an inexperienced far left radical idiot to become president.So we went from doofus, to radical idiot.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	That is NOT progress.The doofus added $4.350 trillion to the national debt in 8 years and the incompetent radical idiot WILL surpass that amount when this fiscal year ends 09/30/2011.&quot;Bush caused the recession!&quot; That is just a statement made out of ignorance of facts and history.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	He did not cause it but he was one of a decades long line of contributors to the eventual collapse of the economy.obama didn't cause the recession either.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	But he did TOTALLY ignore the economy for well over a year attempting &quot;by any means necessary&quot; to get his health care bill passed.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	Yet the health care bill doesn't really start kicking in until 2014.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	The economy was more important and SHOULD have been his priority, NOT some dream way down the road.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	But in retrospect, its a good thing he ignored the economy, he would have made it even worse with his borrow and spend our way out of debt approach.Bush spending was terrible, obama is worse.Bush used the Patriot Act, obama kept the patriot act for his own use.Bush was vilified for the war and the 'surge.' obama has kept the war going and did his own &quot;surge.&quot;Bush was bad because of 'Gitmo.' obama hasn't closed Gimot like he PROMISED he would, in fact, he is quite happy to use it.Bush was a killer for using attack drones.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	obama uses many TIMES more death drones than Bush did.So YES!
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	Bush was bad.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	How does that make obama good?
Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	And if there were no mess, obama wouldn't be president.
Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	I did say that was the only connection.Regardless bush was bad.
Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	That does not make obama good.
Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	He's much worse.
Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	You don't want to believe that but history will list him as the worst president in modern times, maybe ever.No one can say this nation is not in deep financial trouble.
Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	No matter if you love or hate obama, we are in trouble.
Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	And it doesn't matter who you want to blame, the problem STILL has to be fixed.
Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	Blaming is a gross waste of time.So what does the incompetent clown obamalama do about our serious financial problems?
Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	In his accomplished oratory, he eliminates the word spend, and replaces it with, &quot;invest.&quot; Once again insulting the American public with his unbridled arrogance and conceit.
LittleLiberty	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2424	Wow, pay attention to the entire sarcastic post.

Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2426	To the contrary.
Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2426	The economy was tanking at -7% real and losing 700,000 jobs a month and the stock market was tanking and the unemployment rate was skyrocketing before the stimulus passed.
Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2426	Not the economy has been growing for a year and a half, jobs are being created, the stock market is up about 85%, and the unemployment rate is declining.Bi-partisan organizations like the CBO estimate the stimulus saved or created up to over $3 million jobs and decreased the unemployment rate by 1.8 percentage points.

LittleLiberty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2429	Take a look at history.
LittleLiberty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2429	The same problems you blame Obama for were there for a heckuva long time.

LittleLiberty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2429	Because while Bush was president, you wanted to keep living in your fairytale world and believe nothing was wrong with the country, just because a white Republican was in office.

Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2430	It's not a question of belief as to the changes in the economy nor as to the estimates of the bi-partisan CBO.
Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2430	It is well documented fact.

Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2432	Did my post say that obama did not cause the recession?
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2432	Did it say that or did it not say that?Deficit?
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2432	Bush ran up huge deficits and added $4.350 trillion to the national debt.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2432	And the liberal press crucified him for it.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2432	And so did FOX!
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2432	$ 4.350 trillion over 8 years is just over half a trillion per year.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2432	AND THAT IS TERRIBLE.Yet somehow the liberal press thinks that even though obama has run deficits surpassing Bush's deficits and obama is increasing the national debt more than $2 trillion PER YEAR, that is OK because he's black, or for change, or is good because Bush was bad.I'll say it slow for you.BUSH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,obama ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,worse.
LittleLiberty	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2433	I'll say it slow for you.The......problems.......with....this......country.

Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	Perhaps English is not your native language.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	I clearly said that obama was not at fault for the recession.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	However he IS at fault for the incredible, unending, list of mistakes he has made.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	He did not cause the problem as Bush did not cause the problem either.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	But Bush made it worse and the incompetent idiot obamalama has trumped Bush and made a bad situation even worse.Just the money alone.Bush's spending,The liberal media screamed about Bush's spending.FOX screamed about his spending.I screamed about his spending.Did YOU?Now I scream about obama's spending.FOX screams about obama's spending.The liberal media doesn't scream about his spending.Do YOU?Yet by 09/30/2011, 7 months from now, obamalama will have increased the national debt by more actual dollars than Bush did in 8 years.But I'm sure you'll pee in your diapers and say &quot;He had to spend like an insane idiot.&quot; Well every reckless spending politician says that.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	And for obamalama and every other politician its pure unadulterated bullsh!t.That is just one thing, but its the one thing that can ruin the nation.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	There is a laundry list of (*)(*)(*)(*) ups the clown has done.How about the cop and the prof in Mass. RACISM on the president's part.The woman from the Dept of Agriculture.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	He had her fired before knowing a fact.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	Reverse racism on the presidents part.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	Then had MSNBC and the NY Times try to blame it on FOX.How about ignoring the Constitution AND long standing bankruptcy laws and cheating the rightful creditors and giving GM away to the UAW.Or current events, sticking his uninformed and biased nose into the affairs of WI, after being afraid to say anything to Egypt AND IRAN.Or the Iranian warships now in the Mediterranean.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	You can hate Bush but Iran knew if they tried that under Bush, their warships would soon be artificial reefs.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	But because obama is a weakling, they thumbed their nose at the USA.And that's not a 10th of his screw ups.He is an empty suit filled with clever recordings, but that's evidently enough to fool you.
LittleLiberty	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2435	Obama is not the anti-Christ.

Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	{Mod Edit: Personal insults are against the TOS}.Never have you seen me even hint any connection between the incompetent fool [no wonder you like him] obama and Hitler.Palin was the throwaway sacrificial lamb to fill out the Republican ticket that they knew they were going to lose.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	They just thought they were going to lose to Hillary, not the clown prince of nothing.All Palin is and continues to be is a distraction.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	Her celebrity is 100% the fault of the left wing press.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	Had they ignored her she would be a footnote in history now.The spending?Google or Bing the official US Treasury total of the National debt.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	At the end of Bush's last fiscal year it was $10.024 trillion, an increase of $4.350 trillion over Clinton..
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	At the end of Clinton's last fiscal year the debt was $5.674 trillion.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	You could look it up instead of immaturely calling anyone a liar when YOU are 100% wrong.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	And as of TODAY the national debt is at $14.175 trillion.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	In case you are remedial at math and reading, that is an increase of $4.151 trillion.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	So only $199 Billion more and he passes Bush's total.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	And only $849 billion to pass the $5 trillion mark, this year.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	And that is 7 months from now[US fiscal year ends 09/30 each year].
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	He is a lock to pass Bush, the only question is how far past the $5 trillion mark he will push the national debt THIS YEAR.You might also check the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] official estimate of the projected debt from obama's spending.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	Its a shocking number, and that's the CBO.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	They are they official estimators for the Government.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	They are the same ones that said obamalamacare would be deficit neutral and even might save about $200 billion.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	They've since backed away from that nonsense.It took the crazy, wasteful, reckless spending Bush 8 years to increase the debt that much.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	The clown obama is spending at a rate much more than twice Bush's.And if you claim that is not true.

Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	Well, I have a &quot;bit of sense&quot; and a blue ribbon education to boot and what you imply borders on stuff espoused by conspiracy theorists like the John Birch Society.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	These people hate everybody; and according to them, anyone who disagrees with them are &quot;brainwashed liberals.&quot; Well, investigate their rhetoric and one soon discovers that just about every word they utter is without foundation -- past and present.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	I've been invited to their meetings and went.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	They appeal to everyone who has a grudge and it's always the &quot;liberals&quot; who are to blame -- you name it, they're responsible.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	At one time, it was the &quot;commies&quot; and &quot;fellow-travellers,&quot; now it's &quot;liberals.&quot;
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	Young people are liberal because they react to the overt and covert unfairness and injustice they see in their country, coming from the so-called &quot;adults.&quot; This includes often ideas and behavior they observe coming from their own parents.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	They are brainwashed by ALL media (from kindergarden to high school and beyond) that the USA is the greatest country in the world because citizens are &quot;free&quot; to think, feel, see opportunity and be successful just by following &quot;the rules,&quot; and by working hard.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	Well, NONE of that is true.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	It's a fairy tale, just like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	By age 11 or 12, most kids see the hypocrisy.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	What they do then is try to affect some change to reflect the &quot;dream&quot; to help make the dream come true.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	(That's what is going on in the ME right now!)What the hell does this statement mean?
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	It doesn't make any sense!
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	No one who has seen photos of the holocaust could make this statement.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	It's so totally &quot;off line.&quot; Your forum name is certainly apropos because only an &quot;anarchist&quot; (meaning &quot;outlaw&quot;) could stomach that kind of political .
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	This statement describes Bratboy Bush to the &quot;Tea&quot; party, more than to Obama.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	How could Obama with just a bit over 2 years in office have made a record like the one you opine?
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	As for your &quot;boy&quot; Terry Lakin, I suggest his web site is more a strong plea for contributions than for &quot;truth.&quot;
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	Every source you post here is, without question, HARD HARD RIGHT WING NUTS!
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	No one with even an ounce of &quot;common sense&quot; would accept this &quot;Junk&quot; rhetoric as anything more than &quot;Junk&quot; food fried up for mentally challenged ideologues.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	You have some nerve complaining about Obama when you offer up this cholesterol jammed greasy snake oil to anyone!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	If anyone is an &quot;ass&quot; here, it is the one who can't handle the truth!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	And, you, DanNO have a struggle with the simple truth that others point out to you.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Interesting.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	She's referred to herself as a &quot;Mama Grizzly&quot; and a pit bull wearing lipstick, but &quot;sacrificial lamb&quot; is not in her vocabulary.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Agreed!
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	ooooooooooooo.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Naughty, naughty.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Must'nt call people names because it isn't polite on this forum.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Tho' I know of one that allows such things and even more &quot;dirty&quot; words than you can think to spout.Look, DanNO40, I can agree with you about the spending.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I have been called &quot;cheap&quot; for my adherence to fiscal responsibility.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I say I am &quot;frugal&quot; and let it go at that.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I consider myself a very responsible &quot;saver&quot; and &quot;investor&quot; (For example, I bought Apple when it was $14 a share.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I pat myself on the back every day for that bit of insight.)
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I am NOT an economist.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Most economists I have had experience with are &quot;air&quot; heads, meaning they are all theory and not realists.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	So much for the likes of Bernanke, Greenspan, Volker et.al.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	(Tho' I was gratified that Greenspan finally 'fessed up about his idol Libertarian, Ayn Rand, had got it wrong).
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	But, I also think that success in business does not guarantee that that person is qualified to govern a country.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Too very different jobs.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	A CEO's only job is to make a good profit.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	A President or other leader of a country must provide for &quot;the people's best interest, way of life and protection of life.&quot; Very different obligations.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	IOW, A CEO's first obligation is to make money for the shareholders.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	A President's first obligation is to promote the people's welfare from birth to death.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I think Obama has tried to do that.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Further, I don't expect him to be &quot;perfect&quot; particularly in the light of his predecessor's inept performance.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I've said before that I am an Independent -- and I am.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I happen to know and respect one very able and competent Republican Senator, Richard Lugar.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I also know and respect another very able and competent long time Democratic Senator, Carl Levin.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Both, are brilliant and above all, politically reasonable and responsible.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	My personal recollection of these two well behaved politicians is that they are rubbing their collective heads in dismay at what is going on in Washington today.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I feel bad for what they must cope with in today's political climate.
Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	As David Letterman would say, &quot;I wouldn't wish that on a monkey sittin' on a rock.&quot;
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	Your words about economists are the most reasonably intelligent posts you have made.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	There are a couple of know nothing clowns on another thread that tried to say that I didn't know anything about business because I wouldn't hire an economists.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	Even after I pointed out to them that economists make up less than 3/10thoudandths of the private sector workforce.I disagree that the president's job is to promote the people's general welfare from birth to death.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	His job is to take care of the nation so that people can promote their own welfare.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	You may think that is the same thing, I believe otherwise.Providing an atmosphere where both large and small, union and non-union companies could hire again would allow PEOPLE to provide for themselves.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	Instead he has pursued a leftist agenda, providing actual welfare rather than promoting anything but his own agenda.And the spending, that he shows no sign of even truly acknowledging, is a knife in the heart of the nation.And his predecessors ineptness, is a given.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	Now how does that make obamalama anything more or less than he is?Bush was inept, obamalama is more so.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	I'd greatly prefer that was not the case.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	I'd prefer that we had a capable Chief Executive, but having been a CEO and having interviewed and hired executives.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	I would not hire BHO for anything above middle level sales.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	And I'd have his immediate supervisor watch him very closely since I never allowed any salesman to sell on anything but quality and service.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	And I'd be very wary of him overselling with loads of BS.And what Letterman says is unimportant.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	I don't know why he sold out his talent to the liberal left, but he did.Ayn Rand was a Russian.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	Most likely had experiences that neither her fans nor her distractors ever will have.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	She was an excellent author.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	I've enjoyed many if not all of her books.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	They are fiction.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	No different than the movies, make believe.
Hijothis	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2441	All of your credit just went out the window.
Hijothis	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2441	ALL of it.
Hijothis	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2441	Do you even understand the things Regan did for this country?
Hijothis	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2441	Of course you don't.
Hijothis	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2441	In fact, you probably weren't even alive during his presidency.

Hijothis	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2441	Please.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Don't try to blame me for your posts!
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	There is your inexperience and naivety showing through.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Can you say Carter or Nixon?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	And there is that reading challenge rearing its ugly head.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	I CLEARLY said Bush increased the debt by $4.350 trillion in 8 years, and that to do so was terrible.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	But you want to make excuses for the obamalama increasing the debt by $4.151 trillion in just over 1/4th of that time.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Where is the logic or intelligence in that?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	The obamalama will surpass Bush's awful spending in just a few WEEKS, and he will have increased the debt by more than $5 trillion by the end of this fiscal year 9/30/2011.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Fail.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	I mention my service only as an example of one of many learning EXPERIENCES you have not had and cannot imagine.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Many of which help develop a very accurate bullsh!t detector, which the incompetent clown obamalama sets off on an ongoing basis.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Show me where I said BHO is bad for not fixing the economy in the time he's had.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	My complaint is that his singular approach, pour money over it, has not worked and that he spent more than half his presidency ramrodding a bad bill that even his own party had to be bribed and threatened to pass.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	There was and is a crushing priority in the country and it is NOT health care.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	But he had to ignore the economy while he had the control of both Houses of Congress.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Understandable, but a complete failure of judgment.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Even the obamalama hisownself has admitted that &quot;shovel ready&quot; projects were a myth.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	That's not good enough for you?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	When the POTUS admits it, I'm still voicing an opinion?
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	That's amazing.Plus, he had NO business bailing out any state without the consent of the American people.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	But he did bail out states, Democrat states primarily, with a &quot;bait and switch&quot; Stimulus bill.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	It WAS supposed to create jobs.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Covering a states past due bad debts is not creating jobs.And I guess we are even, you don't 'remember' that Nixon was a bad president.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	And I don't remember that Kissinger was ever president.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	A horse and a horse.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Your &quot;source is &quot;Gone with the Wind.&quot;
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	And you would lose that venture.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Your posts reveal all about you.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	You are a closed minded ideologue that isn't ever aware that you are a far left liberal.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	You choose to ignore facts when you find them inconvenient, and little or nothing you say is from your own intellect.Now if you wish to claim that I am also a closed minded ideologue, I will admit that has some merit.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	But at one time I was a member of a union, more than one, and a registered Democrat.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	I gave that up long before FOX went on the air.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	I gave up on liberals and Democrats after observing what they do and the results of what they do.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2444	Palin is an ass who's celebrity is totally the fault of the left wing media attempting to outdo each other by mocking her.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2444	Had the leftist media just ignored her after the election, she'd be a footnote now.But what does Palin being a genius or a dolt have to do with obama?
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2444	If Palin was terrific, that wouldn't make obamalama bad.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2444	He does that to himself.
Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2444	And Palin being an ass doesn't make the clown obamalama good either.One has nothing to do with the other.Its liberal loony-ism to attach any cause and effect to any connection between them
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2445	Sorry I neglected to add this in my earlier post.These numbers are NOT my opinion.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2445	However we can safely say that statements like: &quot; oil companies who are making astronomical profits, profits higher that at any other time in history, &quot; are strictly your opinion.The gross incompetent clown's 2 big &quot;Industries of Evil.&quot;OIL Industry, NET profit margin 11.8%HEALTH CARE PLANS, Net profit margin 3.3%Net profit margins of some other industries, not part of the &quot;Industries of Evil.&quot;Beverages, Brewers-18%Industrial metals--17.9%Drug Mfgs.
Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2445	--16.9%Cigarettes---------15.8%Agricultural Chem.-15.2%Info&amp;delivery Ser.-13%Education &amp; train.-11.5%Wireless Comm.-----10.8%Gen.

Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2449	Yes the race will be close because he is superb at campaigning to be president.
Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2449	He is so good at it he has never stopped campaigning to be president.
Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2449	Its a shame that he is so bad at being the president.
onalandline	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2450	You have mistaken me for a Bush fan.
onalandline	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2450	I voted for him, but realized that he had problems of his own.
onalandline	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2450	I couldn't wait for him to be out of office by the end of his second term.Obama is accelerating the decline of our country.
onalandline	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2450	The only thing slowing him down, is the Republican controlled House.
onalandline	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2450	Luckily, he couldn't even get all that he wanted passed when the Dems controlled everything.Now who's in fairytale land and lying to everyone around them?
onalandline	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2451	Where?
onalandline	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2451	All I have seen is an ever-increasing bureaucracy in Washington.
onalandline	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2451	The Public sector, unfortunately, is where the growth is. The economy is stagnating, jobs are not being created like you think, and the unemployment rate is still dismal.
onalandline	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2451	I have serious doubts as to whether or not the stimulus did anything except to increase our deficits.
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2452	You seem to be ignoring a few key facts.
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2452	After Bush wrecked the economy revenue drastically increased, and Obama has also needed to spend a lot to stimulate the wrecked economy, so the direct comparisions to Bush are intellectually dishonest.Bush had no excuse for what he did.
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2452	Tax cuts for the rich and 2 unneccessary wars are what blew up the deficit.
Tarrant	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2453	The republicans are slowing him down?
Tarrant	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2453	Hilarious.
Tarrant	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2453	Which party held unemployment benefits hostage so the bush tax cuts could be extended and blew another 800 billion hole in the deficit?
Tarrant	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2453	Republicans.They are the ones trying to destroy this country, which they did for 8 years but now they really want to finish it off because an Obama failure, is the only way to fool the sheep into voting them back into power.Which party ensured the financial reform bill was as weak as (*)(*)(*)(*) and ineffective?
Tarrant	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2453	Again the republicans, and the result will be another crash.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	Whine out obamalama excuses all you wish, but as bad as Bush was, the incompetent clown obamalama is worse.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	MUCH WORSE.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	Comparing Bush and the clown is comparing dumb and dumberer.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	The seeds of the destruction of the economy were planted long before Bush showed up.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	Bush was ineffective in stopping those seeds from sprouting.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	And the clown obamalama is even worse at correcting the economy.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	But that is not his fault.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	He is a politician and it is politicians that caused to economy to be set up to collapse over some decades.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	So while NOT fixing the economy is not obamalama's fault.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	Running up enormous debt in the process IS his fault.THERE is no arguing or excusing the debt numbers.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	Bush increased the debt by $4.350 trillion over 8 years.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	The last 2 years and the highest increases were under total Democrat control [including the rookie, JUNIOR Senator obama] But Bush DID sign the increases.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	And since the end of Bush's last full fiscal year, the debt has increased by another $4.2 trillion.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	So in this SHORT time the incompetent clown fool obamalama, has increased the debt by nearly as much as Bush did in 8 years.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	And for a kicker the clown fool has just submitted a budget that he LIES and says it will reduce deficits by $400.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	billion while the debt will increase by $7 TRILLION.We can file the fool obamalama under the heading, &quot;Be Careful What You Wish For!&quot;
Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2455	The economy is not stagnating, it's growing.
Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2455	About 3% real last year.
Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2455	A big improvement over the -7% decline in early 2009.You may have serious doubts, but the economic data showing a turnaround in the economy and the fact that the CBO has calculated the stimulus saved or created millions of jobs is not a matter of belief, but a matter of record.You can find the data on economic growth at: BEA.govYou can find the data on unemployment at: http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htmYou can see stock market performance here: http://www.google.com/finance?client...DEXDJX:grin:JIYou can see CBO reports on the stimulus here: http://www.cbo.gov/publications/coll...cfm?collect=12
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2456	So your actually denying that in a recession , goverment revenue drops drastically?, and that in a recession it is vital for the goverment to spend to stimulate the economy?
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2456	You are disagreement with basic economic fundamentals im afraid.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2457	Bush inherited a budget surplus and squandered it, running up $5 trillion more debt.Obama inherited a great recession and most of the debt he has incurred is because of that.Whether he can preside over a meaningful deficit reduction with the House in control of Republicans who refuse to consider increasing revenues will remain to be seen.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2457	But I have always been critical of Obama's relatively lax attitude toward the budget (though he was the only president in decades to actually reduce spending last year).
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2457	It was a reason I supported Clinton.
Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2457	Unfortunately, McCain gave no reasonable alternative.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2458	To which of the 50 or so &quot;basic economic fundamentals&quot; do you refer?
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2458	Not that it matters since every one is &quot;theoretical.&quot;Prior to this economic downturn, the one where we spent the most government money, took from 1929 until 1946 and a World War to correct.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2458	Other times government has lowered taxes and got out of the way of the private sector to allow the economy to recover on its own, and it has.And here is a &quot;basic economic truth&quot; for you.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2458	This present recession is 100% the fault of long term meddling in business by politicians of both parties.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2458	Politicians, no matter what label they attach to themselves caused the housing, financial and securities troubles with laws they have passed and laws they repealed.To look to politicians to correct the problem that they ignore they created is the height, or depth, of folly.
Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2459	Just out today for you:US manufacturing activity hits 2004 highWASHINGTON &#8212; US manufacturing grew for the 19th straight month in February as a jump in employment and production drove activity to a nearly six-year high, a key industry survey showed Tuesday.Employment also rose 2.8 percentage points, to 64.5 percent, climbing above 60 percent &quot;for only the third time in the last decade,&quot; Ore said.http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp...01ac4be9a7.45119 months ago it was July 2009, about 3-4 months after the stimulus passed.
Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2459	Mere coincidence?
Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2459	Our conservative friends would have you believe that.
Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2459	The bi-partisan CBO says otherwise.
JTFREEBIRD	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2461	I will not be voting for this idiot Obama.
JTFREEBIRD	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2461	And for the Dems to be up in arms over what's going on in Wisconsin is fairly hypocritical after all the things he and Pelosi shoved down the American peoples throats!
JTFREEBIRD	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2461	I am betting we get a Newt Gingrich/Allen West ticket elected in 2012!
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2462	The ones I directly referred to in my post.
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2462	Revenue dropping in a recession is not theoretical, its established basic fact.
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2462	Not sure why your debating economics when you dont even understand the basics.
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2462	When you say 'meddling' I hope you are referring to the deregulation that allowed the financial sector to run wild and eventually impode.
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2462	Its a direct result of not enough goverment meddling or regulation.
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2462	that caused the problem, and the republicans have ensured, the problem remains not fixed, although its almost certain that Obama also never wanted it fixed himself becauuse that would upset his corporate masters.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	I am certain that I understand economics far better than you.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	Yes Government revenue is very likely to drop in a recession.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	But the revenue did not drop by $4 trillion dollars.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	And Govt spending is but one possible way to help in a recession.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	And it is possibly the worst way, as every dollar the Government spends is a dollar taken out of the economy, since the economy IS the source of the govt money.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	The so called deregulation was the repeal of long standing effective regs for new regs of political expediency.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	And you can forget about Republicans taking the blame.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	And I AM NOT a Republican, and never have been a registered Republican, but once was a registered Democrat.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	BOTH parties caused our present day problems.

Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	Some wise and well considered regulation is necessary.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	But creating Securities out of sub-prime loans is not good regulation.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	Nor is passing laws that led to the creation of sub-prime loans.And the new financial regulations are a hastily slapped together mish-mash of ill considered political posturing that will cause more problems than they solve.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	And will cost the public untold millions of dollars in unnecessary bureaucratic fees.And those &quot;corporate masters&quot; certainly should be Flogged on an hourly basis.Look what they do to us.Provide essentially all of the nations jobs.Pay the bulk of our taxes.Provide every good, product, and service you desire.You should skip trying to talk economics when YOU haven't the first shred of a clue what economics are about.
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	Goverment spending goes back into the economy, its not taking out, and if its directed properly it has the best stimulus multiplier.
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	Unemployment benefits for example is maybe the highest multiplier because its spent so quickly and so many different industries profit from it.
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	What in ur opinion is a better way to stimulate demand in the economy, other than directly creating jobs programs or giving money to the people to spend?
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	Let me guess, tax cuts?
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	They sure helped the economy in the last decade didnt they?
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	lol.
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	In other words deregulation, as reducing restrictions and control of what the financial industry can do.
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	Its ok you can say the word.
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	Again thats all called deregulation, and I agree both sides are to blame.
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	No they dont, not the richest few percent.
Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	They play a strong factor in all these areas though but that does not justify them bribing and corrupting the political system and exploiting the country.

Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2466	But replacing a good regulation with a bad one is still regulation, not deregulation.The politicians did not create a situation where &quot;anything goes!&quot; They created one where it was regulated to &quot;only ridiculous nonsense that cannot possibly last, goes!&quot;Politicians cannot conceive of the idea of actual DEregulation.
Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2466	To a politician, every thing must be regulated to their own best advantage.The media misuses the word deregulation, and many others, often.

Sassy	oldjar07	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2565	Liberals got the gridlock they deserve; the conservatives got the gridlock they deserve and the rest of us have to bite our lip and live with the consequences.
Sassy	oldjar07	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2565	I deeply resent that perspective.Since your post suggests that not enough &quot;good&quot; candidates are available, pray tell me your solution to that dilemma?
Sassy	oldjar07	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2565	We have 2 parties in power in this country and because the individual &quot;states&quot; determine how a candidate is qualified to run, the most powerful party makes that decision.
Sassy	oldjar07	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2565	Money is usually the determinate factor.Take the money out of ALL politics and that levels the playing field for ALL candidates as well as the voters.
Sassy	oldjar07	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2565	Why?
Sassy	oldjar07	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2565	because candidates are no longer under pressure to &quot;reward&quot; those who donate to get the candidate elected.Another improvement would be to redistrict the country according to the Constitution, not limit the number to 435 districts; begin nonpartisan redistricting according to population alone, not by political party; get rid of the electoral college; return the office of President and V.P. to be voted on separately so that the candidate with the most votes becomes President and the next highest vote getter becomes V.P.
Sassy	oldjar07	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2565	(this was the way it was historically done just after the Constitution was adopted).
Sassy	oldjar07	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2565	These changes take the &quot;selection power&quot; out of party politics and returns that power to the voters where it &quot;should&quot; be, as you idealize.
Sassy	oldjar07	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2565	That going to happen?
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2566	The teabaggers are radical.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2566	Radicals tend to tune into the anger the general population is feeling and gain popularity for a time.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2566	Egypt is a example.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2566	The people managed to overthrow the &quot;hated&quot; head of state, but after the dust settles, the army remains the only stable organization; and that's exactly from where Mubarak rose to power.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2566	The teabaggers gained power in the southwest and southern Republican party (democrats until LBJ passed the civil rights act); from religious conservative Democrats (blue dogs) in the midwest; and Fox News who has become a doggerel political party using so called public owned airways.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2566	Thanks to union buster Ronald Reagan, the once powerful labor unions that literally &quot;made&quot; the middle class after WWII have lost PAC power; and Reagan's tax aversion to ALL public education initiatives for American children, the quality of educated young people in America has deteriorated dramatically.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2566	We rank no where near the top 5% globally we once did.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2566	Home schooling is a dismal failure when it comes to giving children the tools they need to &quot;lead&quot; the world in trade, finance, invention.So, ra, and the rest of the teabag NRA militia, tote your guns to political rallies and shoot to wound and kill the opposition representatives you hold with vicious contempt and hatred.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2566	That creates chaos and fear for a time, but eventually, even that becomes intolerable and the majority will out at the voting box.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2566	So, stick to your delusions.

Sassy	Metal Head	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2567	Really?
Sassy	Metal Head	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2567	He's trying to lead from the center.
Sassy	Metal Head	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2567	That means he offends both those who are strongly liberal and conservative, but it doesn't follow that what he's doing or has done is wrong.
Sassy	Metal Head	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2567	When Bush was at this same period in his Presidency, he had moved the USA into 2 wars, one of which after 10 years we now know was based on a blatant lie; the other he called a &quot;war&quot; any reasonable person would say we can't win now or ever.
Sassy	Metal Head	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2567	Yet, Bush was elected to a 2nd term.
Sassy	Metal Head	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2567	Based on the above, I'd suggest that most American voters are gluttons for political punishment.

flounder	magnum	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2568	Bush was there eight years.The Liberals are so frustrated they are causing violence all over, and unemployment is still a major problem.

RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	So I was not unhappy to see the rise of the tea party and their power.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	However, I know very little about the detailed inner workings of the tea party.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	I do know MSNBC hates them and FOX loves them,ha ha that's a fairly good endorsement as far as I am concerned!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	That said I will also tell you I am no great fan of FOX but I do SO detest MSNBC!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	They are a violent group masquerading as do gooders when they are just as mean and hateful as what they imagine the awful gun toting right wingers are!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	Ok why do you think the tea party is radical?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	How radical do you think they are?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	Are they as radical as say the Taliban who uses murder and terror to accomplish their goals?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	You make serious claims so you should have serious proof of this violence and that its instigated and approved of by the chairman of the tea party.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	So proof please?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	And PLUEASE no pictures or u tube videos of questionable origins.

RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	Ha ha what is MSNBC pray tell?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	I think that the liberals are simply jealous and fearful that FOX is so popular!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	They are uber terrified that they are in the extreme minority.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	They do not blame themselves, but rather they blame popular talk shows like Rush Borze Savage Beck FOX etc. as being leaders of an right wing conspiracy or something!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	How stupid is that?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	Sorry, that the popularity of the right wing is where the advertising money is! If the fringe leftist view was popular FOX would be courting the left!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	Its that easy eh?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	Again I am not especially enamored with FOX, they like every other capitalistic endeavor.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	They are in business to make money first, sometimes at the expense of the truth, hence the FOXs and the Becks and the Rushes.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	We live in a semi free country and if the majority of the people beleive and want to hear far right talk and are willing to spend money to see it then by god that's whats going to be on TV!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	Its far more a money thing than a political thing.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	I think the leftist liberal airheads are in denial and can not beleive that maybe 80% of the population are more like FOX viewers than like themselves.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	The only good thing the unions did is raise the wage in the early 1900s.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	The trouble is they did not know where to stop and ended up killing the goose that laid their golden eggs.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	I am not pro union but not anti union either.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	The guns carried to those rallies appear to me to be a symbol (look it up it may be a bit of a stretch).
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	If it strikes fear in those that know next to nothing about our history or even human nature so be it.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	Fear is a good motivator.

Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	That's a fragile, rickety fence you sit on.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	What the above post just said is that you &quot;hate&quot; (detest) MSNBC and the people there.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	Now is that the proper spirit for a &quot;Christian&quot; to have toward anyone?
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	Oh, I misspoke, you just said you are a &quot;fringe&quot; Christian and an activist.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	(Wasn't it Jesus who said: Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and unto God that which is God's).
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	Just a reminder: But, isn't that exactly the kind of &quot;righteous&quot; rhetoric and behavior that is antipathy to devoted Christians?
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	Just sayin'?
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	OOOOOO, must I must have hit a &quot;soggy&quot; spot in your teabag.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	I don't have to prove anything I've ascribed to the &quot;teabaggers.&quot; They do it every time one of them opens his/her mouth either in an op ed or to a reporter.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	In fact, they spend as much time 'esplainin' what they mean as they do in making the red faced statement they began with.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	Right wing demagogue M. Bachman is the chairman of the congressional teabag caucus.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	Her best response to a reporter (MTP a week ago) is to ignore the question and repeat outrageous statements she has memorized -- about like RR's repeating the same speech throughout his 8 years as President.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	The other teabagger is Baptist preacher, Huckabee.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	His last public description of Obama as being born and raised in Kenya is undisputed proof that he's as intellectually ignorant and as he is a reprobate Christian (Thou shall not bear false witness).
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	Plus, I like the way YOU dictate to me what you want me to prove!
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	Jealous of Fox News.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	Nooooooo.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	I them because they are so outrageously &quot;obvious&quot; that they &quot;choose&quot; to cater to the lowest common denominator of American voters.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	I can't watch 5 minutes of Glen Beck without laughing out loud.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	He's such a fraud trying to emulate a &quot;professor&quot; when he has neither the education nor the intellect.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	I'd love to see him go up against someone like Christopher Hitchens who would blow him out of the studio both with humor and &quot;facts;&quot; something Beck doesn't recognize unless he invented them.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	What are you then?
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	Do you know?
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	Seems to me that someone who lives in Appalachia, would be very pro-union because of the inhuman conditions miners endure in the coal mines.
Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	Or, are you an advocate for black lung disease, a preexisting condition that insurance carriers refuse to qualify for treatment?
Sassy	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2581	It doesn't do any good to answer &quot;your&quot; charges!
Sassy	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2581	Your response is to dismiss them out of hand and then repeat the same over and over again.
Sassy	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2581	But, that's what Neocons call debate.

jthorp24	Hannibal	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2586	Typical liberal voting rationale.
jthorp24	Hannibal	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2586	I heard that McCain was too old by some of my democrat friends, these people couldn't list any of Obama's stances or McCain's... they claimed it didn't matter because McCain was too old.
jthorp24	Hannibal	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2586	I would rather have an old president who knows what he is doing, than an incompetent one.

RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Confession?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I said the same things (and more) in my introduction.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	So I do not waver in my values.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I am the same when I introed' as I am now, you only had to look at my introduction...
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	No, you lied, I never said I hate nor detest the people there.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	That&#8217;s NOT ok! your pathetic attempts at character assassination are blatantly obvious, and pathetic.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Not only that if you must lie to get a point across its not a point worth making, eh?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	BTW, in my intro I said this; &#8220;Hi to all.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I am a somewhat (non-traditional) conservative leaning semi anarchist type person that is suspicious of a overly large and bloated federal government.&quot; So I do not waver in what I say.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I am a non traditional gun toting ( I carry a .45 with an extended magazine, and a .38, sometimes I also carry a .12 gauge riot shotgun if I am emptying cash vaults at my machines, usually in the early AM).
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Not at all!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Your inaccurate and simple comments are common rhetoric and propaganda used by those that hate Christians and Christianity.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	The personalities of those types of people can be mildly violent to dangerous psychopaths, that are capable of harming others.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	With all due respect, I am not saying you are one of those type individuals, but your hateful comments about the tea party which is heavily Christian and other conservative groups are nearly identical.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I am not a tea party person nor member, but maybe you can tell me or better yet a moderator what you meant by that phrase ie an 'tea bag?'
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	All talk and no proof.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Every time?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I can claim many things but backing it up with proof is not so easy, especially when 90% of it is a lie.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Your credibility is zero with me because you are fond of making claims without an shred of proof.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	From what I have seen much of the tea party people are normal people, unless the footage is shot by a mike moore or a MSNBC type.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I backed you in a corner because I knew you can&#8217;t prove nearly anything you say!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	And I knew you would lose it and show your true colors (as in above).
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I just wanted everyone else to see the real you!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	In any case your rants are always the same prattle as above.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	An hysterical rant by a beaten (politically) foe.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	If you think the last elections were bad wait until 2012!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Yessssss you are!
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I think morally, as in traditional christian value, FOX viewers are the core of America.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	They are what built America and what will sustain it when the girlie men run away when the going gets tough.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	So IMO, they are the highest denominator and the best people in America.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I don't watch TV news because its mostly entertainment not news.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I have several computers and a short wave.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Thats where I get my news.

RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I am not going to let you run from these two challenges.

RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	A child of God.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I own two christian non profit humanitarian missions and a church (a paper tiger church to support the missions) I recently bought a small vending business....ummm' I hold a MA in comparative Christianity and a BA in general liberal arts (gasp I'm sure).
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I am an artist and a photographer, as well as been around the world a couple of times, once with Uncle Sam, all these claims can be vindicated.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	What are you?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	You like myths eh?
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Oh yes another thing, it ain't clips its MAGAZINES.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Maybe one day you will learn that we, the gun lovers, firearm friends, NRA Howdy Doodie guys (well my basset Bogie is a hoday doe dog), real Americans as Archie bunker would say, won in the last SCOTUS decision, It's we the PEOPLE, not the militia, not the army but myself and my brothers and sisters that have the RIGHT to keep and bear arms.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	And there is not one (*)(*)(*)(*) thing you nor your hysterical friends can do about it.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Say would you consider going out with me? Budda budda byeeee!

RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2592	In addition I asked you to respond to a couple of challenges.
RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2592	Here is my direct quote;
RevAnarchist	Challenge # 1	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2592	AND~
RevAnarchist	challenge #2	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2592	I know back when I was asked the same questions I could not meet the challenge.
RevAnarchist	challenge #2	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2592	Yes I found some minor stuff but not any significant factual errors or fabricated material.
RevAnarchist	challenge #2	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2592	Frankly I do not know that the outcome will be.

Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	I think that Palin is an opportunistic bimbo.
Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	But I KNOW that the obamalama is a worse president than Nixon, Carter and Bush.
Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	[combined or separately] Therefore I have no worry that Palin could possibly be worse than the incompetent clown obamalama.
Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	I would hate to see her elected, but would much rather she than he.obamalama is the worst president in modern times, maybe the worst EVER.
Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	Each day I get more of a feeling that ANYONE else has an excellent chance of being better.
Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	Look at what the idiot clown has done while holding reelection foremost in his plans.
Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	Reelection is his only restraint and yet he has blown over $4 trillion dollars in 2 years.
Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	He will surpass Bush's total debt increase IN THIS FISCAL YEAR!!!!.

Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2638	He gives that to Reid, Pelosi, Geithner, or Bernake to decide whatever they want.

liberalminority	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2641	would have to disagree, no political candidate can be against the interests of all corporations because that is where the money is...also populist is subjective since the US has a big conservative christian base who finds homosexual rights, stem cell research, abortions, etc...all to be immoral.
liberalminority	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2641	americans should vote for President Obama because he picks the good corporations as winners and makes the bad corporations into losers by paying more taxes for socialist initiatives, this is seen in the domestic drilling ban for the bad oil corporations and the tax breaks for the good corporations like GE for investing in clean energy...a republican candidate would allow the oil companies to drill for oil causing wars and pollution and not redistribute wealth from the rich and bad corporations to the middle class, President Obama is a hybrid of socialist and corporatist and that is better than a republican who is a capitalist and corporatist.
Come Home America	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2642	Uh, right, more like the fact that Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of GE, is one of Obama's top campaign contributors.
Come Home America	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2642	The man whom Obama appointed to the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, and to serve as chairman of the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, while GE pays no taxes on its massive profits.
Come Home America	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2642	Obama is doing everything you say &quot;a republican candidate&quot; would do.
Come Home America	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2642	It is Obama who has been pushing for more drilling in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.
Come Home America	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2642	It is Obama who has launched illegal wars in Libya, Yemen, and Pakistan, while escalating Afghanistan and lying about ever withdrawing from Iraq.
Come Home America	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2642	It is Obama who has pushed hard to protect tax breaks for the rich, and has been obsessed since the day he got into office with cutting Social Security and Medicare.Obama has not a single socialist impulse.
Come Home America	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2642	He is a hardcore right-wing neoliberal capitalist whose idol is Ronald Reagan.
Polly Minx	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2643	You make a good point in highlighting that populism can be subjective...however, I think you know what I really meant by the use of the term: I was referring to one being a standard leftist populist, not a rightist populist (like the Tea Party movement).You are also correct to point out that not all commercial interests are equally hostile to the broader public interest.
Polly Minx	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2643	But still, I was going beyond that.
Polly Minx	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2643	I was saying that he is not only supported by liberal capitalists, but also has genuine loyalties to the ordinary population.
Polly Minx	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2643	(i.e. That he is at least a part-time populist.)
Polly Minx	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2643	He isn't a slam dunk on either side of that equation.
Polly Minx	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2643	He can be pressured into leaning toward either side.I of course wasn't trying to say that Obama is &quot;against the interests of all corporations&quot;.
Polly Minx	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2643	Frankly, I have no idea how you got that that interpretation of my post.
Polly Minx	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2643	I just meant that he is not strictly, or even necessarily principally, beholden to commercial interests of any sort.
Joe Six-pack	rstones199	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2644	Me too, unless Ron Paul gets the GOP nom.
9/11 was an inside job	Joe Six-pack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2645	anybody who votes for any other candidate other than ron paul is a fool especially the 192 people that have said they will vote for obama again.guess they must all be black people.Many blacks dont sem to care that he has continued everything Bush got started and lied about everything he said he was going to do and has expanded and accelerated the recession.Guess all those 192 Obama lovers love it that he is taking us down towards nazi germany same as Bush,Clinton,congress and all those other candidates that do not believe in the constitution.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	That's the question that popped into my head vis-à-vis you when I read that bizarre claim that Wall Street's man Obama is some kind of &quot;populist&quot;.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Obama's economic policies are the same as Bush's.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	&quot;Stimulus packages&quot; which are smoke and mirrors, consisting largely of kickbacks and &quot;tax cuts&quot; which don't produce a single job.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Obama has done nothing to address any fundamental problems with the U.S. economy.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	He did not re-instate any serious financial regulation, like the Glass-Steagall Act, which was repealed under the last right-wing Democratic president.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	He has done nothing to address any of the flawed &quot;free trade&quot; agreements which have driven out jobs and lowered standards...also signed by Clinton.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Rather he is instead pushing for new ones like KORUS, so American jobs can now be sent to North Korea too.He has done nothing to address the soaring costs of healthcare weighing on America's economy, taking single-payer off the table before the whole fake &quot;debate&quot; over his DoleRomneyCare bill even began.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Obama has accepted the Tea Party consensus that there is a &quot;debt crisis&quot; going on, and that programs like Medicare and Social Security are to blame for it.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	He has accepted the idea that we need massive spending cuts even though we are in the middle of a depression and unemployment is already soaring.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Meanwhile he has repeatedly made &quot;deals&quot; violating his own promise to even let the Bush tax cuts expire, never mind the idea of actually making serious reforms to the tax code so the rich might pay their fair share.On the whole, Obama doesn't really represent any major shifts from the neoliberal economic policies that have characterized the past 30 years.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	If anything, he is more effective than Reagan and Bush at actually getting once-sacrosanct Democratic programs like Social Security onto the chopping block.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Obama is black.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Neither occupation will be ending, Polly.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Obama has doubled the number of troops in Afghanistan.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	We don't even know how many thousands of private contractors are on the ground in Iraq.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Never mind a pacifist, I don't see how anyone with a moral compass could possibly find anything to be happy about with the current warmonger-in-chief's policies.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Obama has doubled down on Bush's radical neocon &quot;war on terror&quot; policies, both foreign and domestic.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Well, I wasn't getting into the specifics of Obama's illegal war on Libya.
Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	I was simply making reference to Obama's overall continuation of neoconservative foreign policy, just as he has continued neoliberal economic policy.
9/11 was an inside job	Stupidsheep	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2648	yeah the 192 fools that said they would vote for him again need to look at this video.they wont of course since they are so much in denial.

Iriemon	dixiehunter	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2655	Bush is already out of office.
Iriemon	dixiehunter	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2655	Can he be impeached after he's already left office?
EddyIsHere	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2656	Half of these are just flat out lies...At least he doesn't say giving Snooki and Charlie Sheen tax cuts will create jobs...
Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	He has not kept most of his campaign promises.He has not been transparent.He has/will raise taxes on everyone (no tax cut for 95% of Americans).He has increased spending/size of government to record levels.He has /will increase our deficit to record levels.He ignores The People and pushes through legislation any way he can.He has weakened national security/border security.He has several proposed policies that will hurt Americans and our economy.He is shunning our allies and kissing the asses of our enemies.He continues to spew lies and BS to the American people.Every one of the above is trueHe has kept less than 200 of over 500 promises.
Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	That is not saying he has broken the rest, just has not kept them.Even liberals could not possibly claim there has been ANYTHING transparent about odrama's back room deals.He has VOWED that the tax cuts will expire in Dec 2012.
Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	That will increase the taxes on the rich by $70 billion and increase the taxes on everyone else by $300 billion per year.He already has increased spending and government size and deficits to record levels.
Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	He has never had a deficit below $1,293.5 TRILLION.
Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	No other president EVER had a deficit as high as $500 billion.He pushed obamacare through with threats and bribes to his own party and when passed and still today, the majority of the American People are against obamacare.Selling automatic weapons to criminals across our border is NOT the way to increase border security.His Stimulus bill cost the nation a TRILLION dollars we don't have.
Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	And today our unemployment rate is higher than when the bill was passed which means by simple arithmetic, that there are fewer jobs now than when the bill was passed.
Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	Regardless of his lying claims.And the last two are obvious to anyone alive.And resisting tax increases that would not solve any problem [raising a mere $70 billion per year, MAYBE] and might cause more problems, is NOT asking for tax cuts for Snooki and Charlie Sheen.One other point about tax breaks.
Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	odrama is currently harping about special tax breaks for &quot;corporate jets.&quot; Do you know where those special tax breaks came from???
Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	odrama's Stimulus bill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Did you know that the debt commission that odrama formed, that he hand-picked, to study ways to reduce our deficits and debt, RECOMMENDED that tax rates be LOWERED?
Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	Think that might be why odrama IGNORED their report after they gave it to him last Dec.?
tomteapack	Joe Six-pack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2659	I will have to vote for Obama, anyone that ALL the parties are mad at, must be doing something right.

tomteapack	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2717	If the taxes were half what they were during the time of Reagan there would be no deficit.
tomteapack	gypzy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2718	Please find me any tea party meeting in which twelve out of one hundred were black--PLEASE????

Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2720	FY 2007 the deficit was $161 billion.FY 2006 the deficit was higher than FY 2007,FY 2005 the deficit was higher than FY 2006,In others words the deficit was diminishing for 3 years in a row.
Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2720	NOT increasingNow FY 2007 the FEDERAL revenue was $2,568 trillion and we spent $161 billion more than that or $2,729 TRILLION.
Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2720	That can in no way be interpreted as GOOD.However AS OF YESTERDAY, with 41 days left in FY 2011, Our Federal income projects to be $2,483 TRILLION.
Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2720	Or $85 billion less than it was in FY2007.
Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2720	But our deficit projects to be $1,600 TRILLION.
Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2720	So we're short $85 billion in income and we've increased the deficit by a factor of 10.We had the same 2 wars going on and we had the tax cuts in FY 2007.
Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2720	How do you justify a deficit increasing TENFOLD on nearly the same income?
IndridCold	k995	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2721	Risk-reward relationship.
IndridCold	k995	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2721	If we elect Ron Paul and his policies somehow get enacted (or some of them) and they work as he claims they will, we'll know to try and get more like him in office.
IndridCold	k995	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2721	If not, we know to not elect someone like him again.

jthorp24	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2724	Why does that matter?
jthorp24	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2724	Most blacks claim to be democrats.

jthorp24	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2724	Using your logic... blacks are the only race who isn't racist... so we must look at them to determine if the tea party is racist.It's comical at best.
